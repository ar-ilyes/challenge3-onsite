# AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard No. (7): Salam and Parallel Salam - Simplified Overview

**Context:** This standard sets out accounting rules for recognizing, measuring, presenting, and disclosing Salam financing and Parallel Salam transactions by Islamic banks, based on juristic (Shari'ah) principles.

## Key Principles of Salam

*   **Sale with Deferred Delivery, Immediate Payment:** Salam is a sale contract where the price (Ra's Al-Mal) is paid in full by the buyer (Al-Muslam) at the time of contracting, for a commodity (Al-Muslam Fihi) to be delivered by the seller (Al-Muslam Ileihi) at a future specified date.
*   **Specificity of Commodity:** The commodity (Al-Muslam Fihi) must be clearly specified as to its kind, type, quality, and quantity.
*   **Capital (Ra's Al-Mal):**
    *   Must be known and paid upfront.
    *   Can be in cash. This standard also permits payment in kind (e.g., trading assets) or as a benefit, valued at fair value agreed by parties.
    *   Cannot be a cancellation of a pre-existing debt owed by the seller (Al-Muslam Ileihi).
*   **Delivery:**
    *   Must be deferred to a future date.
    *   The delivery date should be specified and not contingent on unknown events.
    *   The place of delivery should be designated or determined by custom.
*   **Non-Permissibility of Sale Before Receipt:** Generally, Al-Muslam Fihi cannot be sold by the buyer (Al-Muslam) *before* receiving it.
*   **Parallel Salam:** A second, independent Salam contract where the bank, having entered into an initial Salam contract as a buyer (Al-Muslam), enters another Salam contract as a seller (Al-Muslam Ileihi) to sell a similar commodity. The execution of the second Salam contract must *not* be legally dependent on the execution or fulfillment of the first one.

## Objective of the Standard

To establish accounting rules for Salam financing and Parallel Salam transactions for Islamic banks.

## Scope of the Standard

*   **Applies to:**
    1.  Salam financing transactions.
    2.  Parallel Salam transactions.
    3.  Treatment of Ra's Al-Mal (capital) paid by the Islamic bank in a Salam transaction (when it is the buyer) or received by the bank in a Parallel Salam transaction (when it is the seller).
    4.  Accounting for the receipt and subsequent sale of Al-Muslam Fihi by the bank in a Salam transaction, or the delivery of its like in a Parallel Salam transaction.
    5.  Related revenues, expenses, gains, and losses.
*   **Disclosure of Conflict:** If the standard's requirements conflict with the Islamic bank's charter or local laws, this conflict should be disclosed.

## Key Definitions (Simplified)

*   **Salam:** Purchase of a commodity for deferred delivery in exchange for immediate payment according to specified conditions.
*   **Al-Muslam (Purchaser):** The party buying the commodity and paying the price upfront (often the Islamic bank in a Salam financing).
*   **Al-Muslam Ileihi (Seller):** The party selling the commodity for future delivery and receiving the price upfront.
*   **Al-Muslam Fihi (Commodity):** The subject matter of the Salam contract to be delivered in the future.
*   **Ra's Al-Mal (Salam Capital/Price):** The price paid by Al-Muslam to Al-Muslam Ileihi at the time of contracting.
*   **Parallel Salam:** A Salam contract where the Islamic bank acts as Al-Muslam Ileihi (seller), typically after having entered a primary Salam contract as Al-Muslam (buyer) for a similar commodity. The two contracts are independent.

## Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank

**A. Salam Financing (Bank as Al-Muslam - Buyer)**

**1. Recognition & Measurement of Salam Capital (Ra's Al-Mal) - At time of contracting:**
    *   **Recognition:** Salam financing (an asset) is recognized when the Ra's Al-Mal is paid (cash, kind, or benefit) to Al-Muslam Ileihi or made available to him.
    *   **Measurement:**
        *   If Ra's Al-Mal is **cash:** Measured by the amount paid.
        *   If Ra's Al-Mal is **in kind or benefit:** Measured at the **fair value** (value agreed between the bank and the client) of the asset or benefit provided.
    *   **Presentation:** Presented in the bank's financial statements under "Salam Financing" (asset).

**2. Measurement of Salam Capital - At end of financial period (before receipt of Al-Muslam Fihi):**
    *   Salam capital (asset) is measured as at the time of contracting (see 1 above).
    *   **Provision for Deficit:** A provision for the estimated deficit shall be made if:
        *   It is probable that Al-Muslam Ileihi will not deliver Al-Muslam Fihi (in full or in part).
        *   It is probable that the value of Al-Muslam Fihi (upon future receipt) will decline below the carrying amount of the Salam capital.

**3. Receipt of Al-Muslam Fihi (Commodity):**
    *   **Goods received as per contract:** Recorded as inventory/assets at their **historical cost** (which is the amount of Ra's Al-Mal originally paid).
    *   **Receipt of similar kind but different quality:**
        *   If market value (or fair value if MV not available) of *received* goods **=** Book value of *contracted* goods: Received goods are recorded at the book value of the Salam capital.
        *   If market value (or fair value if MV not available) of *received* goods **<** Book value of *contracted* goods: Received goods are measured and recorded at this lower market/fair value at the time of delivery. The difference is recognized as a **loss.**
    *   **Failure to receive Al-Muslam Fihi (or part thereof) at due date:**
        *   If delivery date is extended: The book value of Salam capital (asset) remains as is.
        *   If contract is cancelled (fully/partially) and Al-Muslam Ileihi does not repay Ra's Al-Mal: The unpaid amount is recognized as a **receivable** due from Al-Muslam Ileihi.
    *   **Failure to receive due to Al-Muslam Ileihi's misconduct/negligence:** If contract cancelled and capital not repaid, amount due recognized as a receivable. If bank holds securities, proceeds are offset against book value, with any shortfall/excess accounted for.
    *   **Substitution of another kind of goods:** If market/fair value of the substitute good is less than the book value of the originally contracted Al-Muslam Fihi, the substitute is recorded at the lower value, and the difference is a loss.

**4. Measurement of Al-Muslam Fihi *after receipt* (at end of financial period):**
    *   Assets acquired through Salam (now inventory) are measured at the **lower of historical cost and cash equivalent value (net realizable value).**
    *   If cash equivalent value is lower, the difference is recognized as a loss in the income statement.

**B. Parallel Salam (Bank as Al-Muslam Ileihi - Seller)**

**1. Recognition:**
    *   Parallel Salam obligation (a liability) is recognized when the Islamic bank *receives* the Ra's Al-Mal (capital/price) from its client (the buyer in the Parallel Salam).
    *   **Presentation:** Presented in the bank's financial statements as a liability under "Parallel Salam."

**2. Recognition of Profit/Loss on Delivery in Parallel Salam:**
    *   Upon delivery of Al-Muslam Fihi by the Islamic bank (as seller) to its client in the Parallel Salam transaction.
    *   The difference between:
        *   The amount paid by the client to the bank (revenue for the bank from Parallel Salam).
        *   The cost of Al-Muslam Fihi to the bank (typically the historical cost from its original Salam purchase).
    *   This difference is recognized as **profit or loss** for the bank.

## Disclosure Requirements
