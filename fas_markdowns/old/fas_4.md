Okay, here's a simplified Markdown version of AAOIFI FAS 4 (Musharaka Financing), focusing on accountancy, scope, and underlying principles.

# AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard No. (4): Musharaka Financing - Simplified Overview

**Context:** This standard, issued in 1996, sets out accounting rules for recognizing, measuring, and disclosing Musharaka financing transactions by Islamic banks. It is based on juristic (Shari'ah) principles.

## Key Principles of Musharaka

*   **Partnership:** Musharaka is a form of partnership where parties (e.g., Islamic bank and client) contribute capital to a venture.
*   **Profit Sharing:** Profits are shared according to an agreed-upon ratio, which can differ from capital contribution ratios, especially if one partner contributes more work or expertise.
*   **Loss Sharing:** Losses are *always* shared strictly in proportion to the capital contributed by each partner. It is not permissible to stipulate otherwise.
*   **Nature of Capital:**
    *   Capital can be contributed in cash or in kind (e.g., trading assets, non-monetary assets).
    *   In-kind contributions must be valued at their fair value (agreed upon by partners) at the time of contracting.
*   **Non-Guarantee of Capital:** Generally, neither partner can guarantee the capital of the other partner. Guarantees can only be sought against misconduct, negligence, or breach of contract terms.
*   **Management & Work:** Partners typically participate in the work/management of the venture.
*   **Transfer of Shares (in Diminishing Musharaka):** When the bank's share is transferred to the partner, it should normally be at fair value at the time of transfer.

## Objective of the Standard

To establish accounting rules for recognizing, measuring, and disclosing Musharaka financing transactions carried out by Islamic banks and financial institutions, based on Shari'ah principles.

## Scope of the Standard

*   **Applies to:**
    1.  Musharaka financing transactions by Islamic banks.
    2.  **Constant Musharaka** (where capital shares remain constant).
    3.  **Diminishing Musharaka** (where the bank's share is gradually transferred to the other partner).
    4.  Transactions regardless of whether the bank's share is financed from its own funds, commingled unrestricted investment accounts, or restricted investment accounts.
    5.  The Islamic bank's share in Musharaka profits or losses.
*   **Does NOT Apply to:**
    1.  Mudaraba.
    2.  Participations (where the Islamic bank owns shares or units representing an equity stake in *another firm's* capital, as distinct from financing a Musharaka venture).
    3.  Zakah on Musharaka funds.
    4.  Accounting treatment of Musharaka transactions in the *partner's (client's)* books or the Musharaka venture's own separate records. (This standard is for the *Islamic bank's* accounting).

*Note: If the standard's requirements contradict the Islamic bank's charter or local laws, this contradiction should be disclosed.*

## Key Definitions (Simplified)

*   **Musharaka:** A partnership where each party contributes capital (equal or varying) to a new or existing project. Each party becomes an owner of the capital and shares in profits as agreed, and in losses in proportion to capital.
*   **Constant Musharaka:** Partners' shares in capital remain constant throughout the contract period.
*   **Diminishing Musharaka:** The Islamic bank agrees to gradually transfer its share in the Musharaka to the other partner, causing the bank's share to decline and the partner's share to increase until the partner becomes the sole owner.

## Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank

**1. Recognition & Measurement of Bank's Share in Musharaka Capital (At time of contracting):**

*   **Recognition:** The bank's share (cash or in-kind) is recognized when it is paid to the partner or made available on account of the Musharaka.
    *   It's presented in the bank's books under a "Musharaka Financing" account (often with the client's name).
*   **Measurement (Cash Contribution):** Measured by the amount paid or made available.
*   **Measurement (In-Kind Contribution - e.g., trading assets, non-monetary assets):**
    *   Measured at the **fair value** of the assets (the value agreed between the partners).
    *   If this valuation results in a difference between the fair value and the bank's book value of the contributed asset, this difference is recognized as a **profit or loss to the Islamic bank itself** (not as part of the Musharaka's operational profit/loss).
*   **Contracting Expenses (e.g., feasibility studies):** Shall *not* be considered part of Musharaka capital unless otherwise agreed by both parties.

**2. Measurement of Bank's Share in Musharaka Capital (After contracting, at the end of a financial period):**

*   **Constant Musharaka:** Measured at **historical cost** (the amount paid or the value at which the asset was valued at the time of contracting).
*   **Diminishing Musharaka:**
    *   Measured at **historical cost *after deducting* the historical cost of any share transferred to the partner.**
    *   The transfer of a share to the partner is treated as a sale, typically at fair value.
    *   The difference between the historical cost (of the portion of capital sold) and the fair value (sale price received) is recognized as **profit or loss in the Islamic bank's income statement.**
*   **Liquidation of Diminishing Musharaka (before complete transfer):**
    *   The amount recovered for the bank's share is credited to the Musharaka financing account.
    *   Any difference between the book value of the bank's share and the recovered amount is recognized as profit or loss in the bank's income statement.
*   **Termination/Liquidation with Unpaid Due Share:** If the bank's due share of capital (after accounting for any profits or losses) remains unpaid after settlement, it shall be recognized as a **receivable due from the partner.**

**3. Recognition of Bank's Share in Musharaka Profits or Losses:**

*   **Musharaka Commencing and Ending within one Financial Period:**
    *   Profits or losses are recognized in the bank's accounts **at the time of liquidation.**
*   **Musharaka Continuing for More Than One Financial Period (Constant or Diminishing):**
    *   **Profits:** The bank's share of profits for any period (resulting from partial or final settlement) is recognized **to the extent that the profits are being distributed.**
    *   **Losses:** The bank's share of losses for any period is recognized **to the extent that such losses are being deducted from its share of the Musharaka capital.**
    *   (For Diminishing Musharaka, this is applied after considering the decline in the bank's share of capital).
*   **Unpaid Profit Share:** If the partner does not pay the bank's due share of profits after liquidation/settlement, the due share of profits shall be recognized as a **receivable due from the partner.**
*   **Losses due to Partner's Misconduct or Negligence:**
    *   If losses are due to the partner's misconduct or negligence, the partner shall bear the Islamic bank's share of such losses.
    *   These losses are recognized as a **receivable due from the partner.**
*   **Musharaka Receivables:** Unpaid shares of capital or profits are recorded in a "Musharaka receivables account." A provision should be made if these receivables are doubtful.

**4. Disclosure Requirements:**

*   Disclosure should be made in the notes if the bank has made a provision for loss of its capital in Musharaka transactions during the reporting period.
*   General disclosure requirements of FAS No. (1) (General Presentation and Disclosure) should be observed.

## Effective Date

*   This standard is effective for financial statements for fiscal periods beginning **1 Muharram 1418 A.H. or 1 January 1998 A.D.**
