# AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard 32: Ijarah - Simplified Overview

**Context:** This standard (FAS 32) revises and supersedes FAS 8 "Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek." It aims to improve accounting practices for Ijarah transactions, aligning them more closely with global best practices while strictly adhering to Shari'ah principles.

## Key Principles & Shift in Accounting

*   **Shari'ah Compliance is Paramount:** The standard ensures that accounting treatments do not compromise Shari'ah principles or the essence of Ijarah transactions.
    *   **Risk and Rewards of Ownership:** The lessor (owner) retains substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the underlying asset throughout the Ijarah term. This is a fundamental distinction from conventional finance leases.
    *   **Separation of Contracts:** An Ijarah (lease) contract is distinct from any promise or contract for the sale or gift of the asset (e.g., in Ijarah MBT). These are not combined for accounting purposes.
    *   **Usufruct (Right-of-Use):** Ijarah is a contract for the transfer of usufruct (the right to use an asset), not the asset itself or financing.
    *   **Rental Recognition:** Rentals commence only when the asset is delivered to the lessee in a usable condition, not from the date of fund disbursement. No rental is charged if the asset is unavailable for use.
*   **Fundamental Shift for Lessee Accounting:**
    *   Previously, Ijarah was often treated as off-balance sheet for the lessee.
    *   **New Model:** The lessee recognizes a **'right-of-use' (ROU) asset** and a corresponding **Ijarah liability** on the balance sheet.
*   **Alignment with Global Practices (where Shari'ah compliant):** The standard incorporates concepts like ROU asset accounting, but adapts them. For instance, the ROU asset is measured at "prime cost" rather than the present value of minimum lease payments.
*   **Scope Focus:** This standard primarily covers **asset Ijarah** (leases of tangible assets). Service Ijarah involving human effort or technology without a tangible asset element (like bandwidth) is generally excluded. If a service Ijarah involves equipment, it falls under this standard.

## Objective of the Standard

To set out principles for the classification, recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure for Ijarah transactions (including Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek - Ijarah MBT) entered into by Islamic financial institutions, both as lessor and lessee.

## Scope of the Standard

*   **Applies to:** All asset Ijarah and Ijarah MBT transactions for both lessor and lessee.
*   **Does NOT Apply to:**
    1.  Sukuk based on Ijarah (covered by respective FAS).
    2.  Ijarah transactions for exploration, extraction, harvesting, or use/sale of natural resources.
    3.  Service Ijarah transactions (e.g., employment, professional services, intellectual property, detachable rights not involving tangible assets).

## Key Definitions (Simplified)

*   **Ijarah:** A contract transferring the usufruct (right-of-use) of an underlying asset for a period in exchange for an agreed consideration (rentals) from a lessor (owner) to a lessee.
*   **Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek (Ijarah MBT):** A hybrid Ijarah that includes a promise (separate from the Ijarah contract) to transfer ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee at the end of the Ijarah term or gradually during the term, via sale or gift.
*   **Right-of-Use (ROU) Asset:** An asset representing the lessee's legally enforceable right to use an underlying asset for the Ijarah term.
*   **Ijarah Liability:** The lessee's obligation to make Ijarah rental payments.
*   **Operating Ijarah:** An Ijarah not accompanied by an option to transfer ownership of the underlying asset to the lessee.
*   **Commencement Date:** The date the lessor makes the underlying asset available for use by the lessee in a suitable condition.
*   **Lessor:** The party (owner) who transfers the usufruct.
*   **Lessee:** The party who acquires the usufruct.
*   **Underlying Asset:** The asset subject to the Ijarah contract.
*   **Usufruct:** The legally enforceable limited right to use and benefit from an asset, without entailing ownership risks and rewards.

## Classification of Ijarah (for accounting)

1.  **Operating Ijarah**
2.  **Ijarah MBT:**
    *   With expected transfer of ownership *after* the end of the Ijarah term (sale or gift).
    *   With gradual transfer of ownership *during* the Ijarah term (e.g., Diminishing Musharaka Ijarah).

## Accounting by the Lessee

**1. Initial Recognition (at Commencement Date):**
    *   Recognize a **Right-of-Use (ROU) Asset**.
    *   Recognize an **Ijarah Liability**.
    *   Any advance rentals paid before commencement are an asset, then netted against the Ijarah liability at commencement.

**2. Measurement of ROU Asset (Initial):**
    *   **Prime cost** of the ROU asset (generally, lessor's cost/fair value of underlying asset less its expected terminal value at the end of Ijarah term).
    *   Plus: Lessee's initial direct costs.
    *   Plus: Estimated dismantling/decommissioning costs (if applicable and Shari'ah compliant).

**3. Measurement of Ijarah Liability (Initial):**
    *   **Gross Ijarah Liability:** Total Ijarah rentals payable over the Ijarah term (fixed rentals, variable rentals based on an index/rate at commencement, payments for termination if the term reflects this option).
    *   **Deferred Ijarah Cost:** The difference between the Gross Ijarah Liability and the prime cost of the ROU asset. (Presented as a contra-liability).
    *   **Net Ijarah Liability:** Gross Ijarah Liability less Deferred Ijarah Cost.

**4. Subsequent Measurement - ROU Asset:**
    *   Cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses.
    *   Amortized systematically over the useful economic life, which coincides with the Ijarah term.

**5. Subsequent Measurement - Net Ijarah Liability:**
    *   Reduced by Ijarah rentals paid.
    *   Increased by the amortization of the Deferred Ijarah Cost (representing the return element).
    *   Re-measured for contract modifications or changes in Ijarah term/future rentals.

**6. Ijarah MBT through Gradual Transfer:**
    *   Lessee accounts for a **'combined asset'** comprising its proportionate ownership of the tangible asset and its proportionate ROU asset.

**7. Recognition Exemptions (Optional):**
    *   **Short-term Ijarah:** Ijarah term of 12 months or less at commencement.
    *   **Low-value Ijarah:** Underlying asset is of low value when new.
    *   *Accounting for exempt Ijarah:* Recognize Ijarah rentals as an expense on a straight-line basis or another systematic basis.

**8. Presentation & Disclosure:**
    *   ROU assets presented separately or within appropriate asset categories on the Statement of Financial Position.
    *   Net Ijarah liability presented as a liability.
    *   Net Ijarah cost (amortization of ROU asset + amortization of deferred Ijarah cost + variable rentals) in the Statement of Income.

## Accounting by the Lessor

**1. Initial Recognition:**
    *   **Underlying Asset:** Recognized at cost when the lessor obtains control. Cost includes purchase price and other costs to bring it to its present location and condition.
    *   **Advance Rentals Received:** Recognized as a liability.
    *   **Initial Direct Costs (Lessor's):** Costs for arranging the Ijarah (not part of asset cost) are deferred.

**2. Subsequent Measurement - Underlying Asset:**
    *   Cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
    *   Depreciated over its useful economic life on a pattern reflecting the consumption of economic benefits. Residual value is considered.
        *   For Ijarah MBT (gradual transfer): If units sold at cost, residual value equals cost, so no depreciation on sold portions.

**3. Ijarah Revenue:**
    *   Recognized on an accrual basis, either:
        *   Straight-line basis (preferred).
        *   Another systematic basis reflecting the pattern of benefit diminution (e.g., effective rate of return method for certain Ijarah MBT).
    *   For Ijarah MBT (gradual transfer): Revenue progressively decreases as the lessee acquires a greater share.

**4. Ijarah Costs:**
    *   Depreciation of the underlying asset.
    *   Amortization of initial direct costs.
    *   Other costs incidental to ownership (e.g., major repairs, Takaful, taxes, unless contractually and Shari'ah compliantly borne by lessee as agent).

**5. Presentation & Disclosure:**
    *   Ijarah assets presented on the Statement of Financial Position.
    *   Net Ijarah revenue (gross revenue less depreciation and other related expenses) in the Statement of Income.

## Ijarah MBT - Transfer of Underlying Asset's Ownership

*   **Timing:** Transfer of control (and thus ownership) is accounted for when the separate sale/gift contract is consummated.
*   **Lessee (Purchaser):**
    *   Recognizes the acquired asset at its cost (consideration paid/payable) plus any carrying value of the ROU asset reclassified.
    *   For gradual transfer, the 'combined asset' is reclassified to a fully owned asset upon full transfer.
*   **Lessor (Seller):**
    *   De-recognizes the underlying asset (or proportionate part for gradual transfer).
    *   Recognizes any gain or loss on the sale (difference between consideration received and carrying value of the asset/portion sold).

## Sale and Ijarah-back Transactions

*   Treated as two distinct, independent contracts: a sale and an Ijarah.
*   **Seller-Lessee:**
    *   Accounts for the sale (recognizing gain/loss).
        *   If operating Ijarah-back: Gain/loss immediately recognized.
        *   If other Ijarah-back: Gain/loss may be deferred and amortized over Ijarah term if consideration is not at fair value.
    *   Accounts for the Ijarah-back as a lessee (ROU asset and liability).
*   **Buyer-Lessor:** Accounts for the purchase of the asset and the Ijarah as a normal lessor.

## Other Key Treatments

*   **Forward Ijarah (Ijarah Mawsufah fi al-Dhimma):**
    *   Advance payments by lessee are 'advance Ijarah rentals paid' (asset).
    *   Advance payments received by lessor are 'obligation against advance rentals' (liability).
    *   Standard Ijarah accounting applies upon commencement.
*   **Hamish Jiddiyyah (Security Deposit):**
    *   Lessee: Receivable.
    *   Lessor: Liability.
    *   Not netted off against Ijarah liability unless specifically agreed for adjustment against transfer price or final rentals.
*   **Charity:** Payments received from customers against defaults/delays are not recognized as income by the institution but are directed to a charity account.

## Effective Date & Transition

*   **Effective Date:** Financial periods beginning on or after 01 January 2021. Early adoption is permitted.
*   **Transitional Provisions:** Institutions may apply prospectively for transactions executed on or after the effective date (with disclosure of impact).

This standard **supersedes FAS 8**.
