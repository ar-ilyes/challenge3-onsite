# AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard No. (10): Istisna'a and Parallel Istisna'a - Simplified Overview

**Context:** This standard sets out accounting rules for recognizing, measuring, presenting, and disclosing Istisna'a and Parallel Istisna'a transactions by Islamic banks, based on juristic (Shari'ah) principles. It addresses the bank acting as both a seller (Al-Sani') and a buyer (Al-Mustasni').

## Key Principles of Istisna'a

*   **Manufacturing/Construction Contract:** Istisna'a is a sale contract where one party (Al-Sani' - the seller/manufacturer) undertakes to manufacture or construct a specific asset (Al-Masnoo') according to agreed specifications for another party (Al-Mustasni' - the buyer), for an agreed price and method of settlement.
*   **Subject Matter (Al-Masnoo'):** Must be clearly specified. The Al-Sani' provides the raw materials and/or labor.
*   **Price & Payment:**
    *   The price should be known.
    *   Payment can be made in advance, in installments during the manufacturing process, or deferred until after completion/delivery. This flexibility in payment timing is a key differentiator from Salam.
    *   The price can be changed by mutual consent if modifications are made to Al-Masnoo' or due to unforeseen contingencies.
*   **Binding Nature:** While historically there were differing Hanafi views, this standard (and modern Fiqh Academy resolutions) generally treats Istisna'a as a binding contract once constituted, especially if a delivery date is fixed.
*   **Parallel Istisna'a:**
    *   If Al-Mustasni' does not require Al-Sani' to manufacture Al-Masnoo' itself, Al-Sani' (e.g., the Islamic bank) can enter into a second, *independent* Istisna'a contract with a third-party subcontractor.
    *   In this parallel Istisna'a, the bank (Al-Sani' in the first contract) acts as Al-Mustasni' (buyer) to the subcontractor.
    *   The two contracts are legally separate. The bank remains solely responsible to the ultimate buyer in the first contract.

## Objective of the Standard

To establish accounting rules for Istisna'a and Parallel Istisna'a contracts in the financial statements of Islamic banks, covering cost and revenue measurement, gain/loss recognition, and disclosure.

## Scope of the Standard

*   **Applies to:**
    1.  Istisna'a contracts.
    2.  Parallel Istisna'a contracts.
    3.  Accounting when the Islamic bank acts as **Al-Sani' (Seller/Manufacturer).**
    4.  Accounting when the Islamic bank acts as **Al-Mustasni' (Buyer).**
*   **Disclosure of Conflict:** If the standard's requirements conflict with the Islamic bank's charter or local laws, and the bank must comply with those, the conflict should be disclosed.

## Key Definitions (Simplified)

*   **Istisna'a:** A sale contract where Al-Sani' (seller) manufactures/constructs Al-Masnoo' (asset) for Al-Mustasni' (buyer) per agreed specifications, price, and payment terms.
*   **Al-Sani' (Seller/Manufacturer):** The party undertaking to manufacture/construct the asset.
*   **Al-Mustasni' (Buyer):** The party ordering the manufacture/construction of the asset.
*   **Al-Masnoo' (The Manufactured/Constructed Asset):** The subject matter of the Istisna'a contract.
*   **Parallel Istisna'a:** A second Istisna'a contract entered into by Al-Sani' (from the first contract) with a subcontractor to fulfill its obligations. The bank acts as Al-Mustasni' in this second contract. The two contracts are independent.
*   **Istisna'a Work-in-Progress Account:** An asset account accumulating Istisna'a contract costs. When using the percentage-of-completion method, recognized profit is also debited here.
*   **Istisna'a Costs Account:** An asset account used in Parallel Istisna'a to accumulate progress billings from the subcontractor. Recognized profit portion is also debited here.
*   **Percentage-of-Completion Method:** Recognizes revenues and profits of Istisna'a contracts as work progresses, in proportion to the work completed.
*   **Completed-Contract Method:** Recognizes Istisna'a costs and revenues only in the financial period in which the contract is completed.

## Accounting Treatment by the Islamic Bank

**A. Bank as Al-Sani' (Seller/Manufacturer)**

**1. Istisna'a Costs:**
    *   **Components:** Direct costs (e.g., producing Al-Masnoo') and allocable indirect contract costs. (General/admin, selling, R&D costs are *not* included).
    *   **Recognition:** Costs incurred (including pre-contract costs if a contract is signed) are recognized in an **"Istisna'a Work-in-Progress" account (asset).**
    *   **Amounts Billed to Al-Mustasni':** Debited to "Istisna'a Accounts Receivable" and credited to "Istisna'a Billings" account. The balance of "Istisna'a Billings" is offset against "Istisna'a Work-in-Progress" on the statement of financial position.
    *   **Pre-contract Costs:** Deferred if likely to result in a contract; otherwise, expensed.

**2. Contract Costs in Parallel Istisna'a (Bank is Seller in main contract, Buyer in parallel contract):**
    *   **Istisna'a Costs Account (Asset):** Includes the price fixed in the parallel Istisna'a contract (direct cost to the bank) plus indirect costs.
    *   When the subcontractor bills the bank, these are debited to "Istisna'a Costs Account" and credited to "Istisna'a Accounts Payable (to subcontractor)".
    *   Progress billings by the bank to the *ultimate purchaser (Al-Mustasni')* are debited to "Istisna'a Accounts Receivable (from Al-Mustasni')" and credited to "Istisna'a Billings (to Al-Mustasni')". This billings account is offset against the "Istisna'a Costs Account".

**3. Istisna'a Revenue and Profit Recognition (End of Financial Period):**
    *   **Methods:**
        *   **Percentage-of-Completion Method (Preferred if reliable estimates possible):**
            *   Revenue recognized = Contract price portion commensurate with work performed.
            *   Profit margin recognized = Portion of total estimated profit. Recognized profit is added to the "Istisna'a Work-in-Progress" account.
        *   **Completed-Contract Method (If reliable estimates not possible):** No revenue/profit recognized until contract completion. Accumulated costs carried in "Istisna'a Work-in-Progress".
    *   **Deferred Profits:** If the contract price is paid by Al-Mustasni' in installments *after* completion, the difference between total price and payments received during the contract is "deferred profits," offset against "Istisna'a Accounts Receivable." Deferred profits are recognized later, either proportionately over the credit period or as installments are received.
    *   **Early Settlement by Al-Mustasni':** If the bank waives part of its profit for early payment, this waiver reduces both "Istisna'a Accounts Receivable" and "Deferred Profits."
    *   **Parallel Istisna'a Revenue & Profit:** Recognized using the percentage-of-completion method. Recognized profit is added to the "Istisna'a Costs Account".

**4. Measurement of Work-in-Progress & Contract Losses:**
    *   **Valuation (Percentage-of-Completion):** "Istisna'a Work-in-Progress" is measured at a value not exceeding its cash equivalent value (contract price less expected additional completion costs).
    *   **Expected Losses:** Any anticipated loss on a contract is recognized immediately in the income statement by writing down the "Istisna'a Work-in-Progress" (or "Istisna'a Costs Account" in parallel Istisna'a).
    *   **Subcontractor Default (Parallel Istisna'a):** Additional costs incurred by the bank to fulfill its obligation to Al-Mustasni' due to subcontractor default are recognized as losses, unless recovery is reasonably certain.

**5. Change Orders and Additional Claims:**
    *   Value and cost of authorized change orders are added to Istisna'a revenue and costs.
    *   Revenue from additional claims is recognized (equal to additional cost) if requisite conditions (e.g., legal basis, unforeseeable circumstances) are met. If not, disclose as contingent.

**6. Maintenance and Warranty Costs of Al-Masnoo':**
    *   **Istisna'a (No Parallel):** Accrual basis. Estimated costs matched with recognized revenue. Actual expenditures charged against an allowance account.
    *   **Parallel Istisna'a:** Cash basis (since these costs are typically borne by the subcontractor). Costs charged directly to expense by the bank if incurred.

**B. Bank as Al-Mustasni' (Buyer)**

**1. Istisna'a Billings of Completed Jobs:**
    *   Progress billings received from Al-Sani' are debited to an **"Istisna'a Costs Account" (asset)** and credited to "Istisna'a Accounts Payable (to Al-Sani')".
    *   In a **Parallel Istisna'a** (where the bank is Al-Mustasni' to a subcontractor and Al-Sani' to the ultimate buyer), the accounting in A.2.b applies (billings to ultimate buyer offset Istisna'a Costs Account).

**2. Receipt of Al-Masnoo':**
    *   **In Conformity:** Received Al-Masnoo' (asset) is recorded at its **historical cost** (book value of the "Istisna'a Costs Account").
    *   **Parallel Istisna'a (Delivered to Al-Mustasni'):** Balance of "Istisna'a Costs Account" is transferred to an asset account reflecting Al-Masnoo' received (and subsequently delivered).
    *   **Late Delivery (with Compensation):** Compensation from Al-Sani' (e.g., from performance bonds) reduces any recognized receivable due from Al-Sani'.
    *   **Non-Conforming Al-Masnoo':**
        *   If bank declines receipt and doesn't recover progress payments: Balance recorded as "Istisna'a Accounts Receivable," with allowance for doubtful debts if needed.
        *   If bank accepts non-conforming Al-Masnoo': Measured at the **lower of cash equivalent value or historical cost (book value).** Uncompensated loss recognized in income.
    *   **Al-Mustasni' (Client) Refuses to Receive Al-Masnoo' from Bank:** Istisna'a assets held by the bank are measured at lower of cash equivalent value or historical cost. Any loss recognized.
