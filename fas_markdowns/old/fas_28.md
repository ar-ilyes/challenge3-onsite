Okay, here's a simplified Markdown version of AAOIFI FAS 28 (Murabaha and Other Deferred Payment Sales), focusing on accountancy, scope, and underlying principles.

# AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard 28: Murabaha and Other Deferred Payment Sales - Simplified Overview

**Context:** This standard prescribes accounting and reporting principles for Murabaha and other deferred payment sales transactions for both sellers and buyers. It supersedes FAS 2 "Murabaha and Murabaha to the Purchase Orderer" and FAS 20 "Deferred Payment Sale."

## Key Principles of Murabaha & Deferred Payment Sales

*   **Murabaha:** A sale of goods where the seller explicitly discloses the cost of the goods and adds an agreed-upon profit mark-up. Payment can be on a spot or deferred basis.
*   **Murabaha to the Purchase Orderer:** A transaction where a purchaser orders an item, and the seller (e.g., Islamic bank) acquires the item and then sells it to the purchaser on Murabaha terms based on a promise (Wa'ad) from the purchaser.
*   **Deferred Payment Sale:** Any sales transaction where payment of the sales consideration is deferred over a fixed credit term (installments or lump sum).
*   **Ownership & Control:** The seller must own and possess (actually or constructively) the inventory before selling it. The sale is consummated when the contract is legally binding and control (risks and rewards of ownership) of the inventory is transferred to the buyer.
*   **Profit Recognition (Deferred Sales):** For deferred payment sales, the profit element is generally deferred and recognized over the credit period.
*   **Shari'ah Compliance:** All transactions must adhere to Shari'ah principles.

## Objective of the Standard

To prescribe appropriate accounting and reporting principles for recognition, measurement, and disclosures related to Murabaha and other deferred payment sales transactions for both sellers and buyers.

## Scope of the Standard

*   **Applies to:**
    1.  Accounting for Murabaha sales.
    2.  Accounting for other deferred payment sales carried out under Shari'ah principles.
*   **Does NOT Apply to:**
    1.  **Tawarruq** and **commodity Murabaha** transactions (these are scoped out for separate consideration due to differing economic substance and market practices).
    2.  Investments made in investment instruments (e.g., equity instruments, Sukuk) where the underlying asset for such an instrument is a Murabaha or deferred payment sale.

## Key Definitions (Simplified)

*   **Murabaha:** Sale of goods with an agreed-upon profit mark-up on the cost.
*   **Deferred Payment Sale:** Sales transaction with deferred payment of consideration.
*   **Inventory (for this standard):** Asset held for sale in the ordinary course of business or in the process of production for such sale.
*   **Receivable:** The amount due from the buyer.
*   **Promise (Wa'ad):** A constructive obligation, binding under certain juristic conditions (e.g., if pending on a cause and promisee incurs costs).
*   **Arboun:** Amount paid by an intending buyer as security cum advance payment, may be forfeited on default of promise to purchase.
*   **Hamish Jiddiyyah:** Security deposit against fulfillment of a contract or promise.
*   **Net Realizable Value (NRV):** Estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale.

## Accounting by the Seller

**1. Initial Recognition:**
    *   **Inventories:** Recognized when the institution controls the inventory (acquires substantially all risks and rewards of ownership). Measured at **cost** (purchase cost + costs to bring to present location/condition).
    *   **Receivables & Revenue:** Recognized when the inventory is sold under Murabaha/deferred payment sale contract (i.e., at consummation of sale and transfer of control to buyer).
        *   Receivables recognized at **face value (gross amount/invoice value).**

**2. Subsequent Measurement:**
    *   **Inventories:** Measured at the **lower of cost and net realizable value (NRV).**
        *   If a credit-worthy customer has a binding promise to buy at cost or higher, inventory is carried at cost, irrespective of fair value fluctuations.
        *   Otherwise, write-down to NRV if NRV is lower than cost, with the effect recognized in the period of identification.
    *   **Receivables:** Carried at outstanding gross amount less allowance for credit losses.

**3. De-recognition:**
    *   **Inventories:** De-recognized upon sale (transfer of control) or loss of control (e.g., physical loss, theft, technological obsolescence, no expected buyer).
    *   **Receivables:** De-recognized when settled, deemed unrecoverable (insolvency), or waived/written off (as Hibah).

**4. Revenue and Profit Recognition:**
    *   **Revenue:** Recognized as per para 8 (at consummation of sale).
    *   **Cost of Sales:** Carrying amount of inventory sold + direct expenses, recognized when related revenue is recognized.
    *   **Profit Deferment (for deferred payment sales):**
        *   The profit (revenue less cost of sales) is **deferred** through a "deferred profit account."
        *   Exception: If cash sale price > cost of sales, profit up to this difference is *not* deferred.
        *   Deferred profit account is presented as a **contra-asset** to receivables.
        *   **Amortization of Deferred Profit:** Recognized as income over the contractual credit period on a time-proportionate basis.
            *   For >12 months maturity (installments/lump sum): **Effective profit rate method.**
            *   For <=12 months maturity (lump sum): Straight-line allocation is allowable.

**5. Related Accounting Treatments (Seller):**
    *   **Waivers/Discounts on Receivables (e.g., for early settlement):**
        1.  Netted-off against available deferred profit on that transaction.
        2.  Then, against profit recognized/amortized in the current period.
        3.  Remaining balance as an expense.
    *   **Transaction Costs (negotiating/arranging sale):** Charged to income when incurred (net of reimbursements).
    *   **Structuring/Service Fees:** Recognized when related services are provided.
    *   **Subsequent Discounts Received on Inventory (after its sale):** Reduces cost of sales. If passed to customer, reduces gross revenue; if not passed, for cash Murabaha it's income, for deferred Murabaha it increases deferred profit.
    *   **Hamish Jiddiyyah/Arboun Received:**
        *   Initially: Liability of the seller.
        *   Upon sale consummation: Hamish Jiddiyyah remains a liability (security deposit) unless contractually agreed to offset receivables. Arboun (advance payment) is netted off against receivables.
        *   Forfeiture: Accounted for according to Shari'ah rules.
    *   **Charity:** Payments from customers for defaults/delays are not income; taken directly to charity payable.

**6. Presentation and Disclosures (Seller):**
    *   Accounting policies for Murabaha/deferred sales.
    *   Inventories (classified, identifying those under binding/non-binding promises).
    *   Receivables (classified by nature, maturity profiles, secured/unsecured).
    *   Sales revenue and cost of sales (in notes).
    *   Unamortized deferred profits (movement during period, as deduction from receivables).
    *   Outstanding Hamish Jiddiyyah/Arboun.
    *   Profit waived/receivables written off.
    *   Charity amounts.

## Accounting by the Buyer

**1. Initial Recognition:**
    *   **Recording of Purchases:** Asset is considered purchased at consummation of the Murabaha/deferred payment sale (contract legally binding, buyer obtains control).
    *   Recognized at **cost = face value (gross invoice value including seller's profit) + incidental direct acquisition costs.** Classified according to relevant FAS.
    *   **Murabaha/Deferred Payment Sales Liabilities:** Recognized at **face value (gross invoice value including seller's profit)** once control of the asset is procured.

**2. Subsequent Measurement:**
    *   **Assets:** Measured according to accounting principles applicable to their classification (e.g., inventory at lower of cost/NRV, other assets subject to impairment).
    *   **Liabilities:** Carried at outstanding amount (gross liability less repayments/adjustments).

**3. Related Accounting Treatments (Buyer):**
    *   **Waivers/Discounts from Seller:**
        1.  Recognized as a deduction from the value of the respective asset.
        2.  If asset already sold/disposed of, balance recognized as income.
    *   **Hamish Jiddiyyah/Arboun Paid:**
        *   Initially: Deposit or advance against purchases.
        *   Upon sale consummation: Hamish Jiddiyyah remains a deposit unless contractually agreed to offset payables. Arboun is netted off against accounts payable.

**4. Presentation and Disclosures (Buyer):**
    *   Accounting policies for purchases via Murabaha/deferred sales.
    *   Accounts payable (classified by nature, maturity profiles).
    *   Nature/estimated value of securities provided against payables.
    *   Amount waived by the seller during the period.

## Effective Date & Transition

*   **Effective Date:** Financial statements for institutions beginning on or after **1 January 2019.** Early adoption permitted.
*   **Transitional Provisions:** May apply prospectively for transactions executed on/after the effective date (with disclosure of impact).

This standard **supersedes FAS 2 and FAS 20.**
