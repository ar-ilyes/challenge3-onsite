The rationale for each clause is as follows:\\n\\nFAS7.ACC1: This clause addresses the accounting for Shariah-compliant government debt financing, primarily Sukuk. It aligns with AAOIFI AS 17 by requiring initial recognition at fair value and subsequent measurement using the effective yield method. This mirrors conventional debt accounting while ensuring that Shariah-compliant instruments are treated according to their economic substance. Citing FAS 91 provides a familiar analogy from US GAAP for handling premiums and discounts.\\n\\nFAS7.ACC2: This clause focuses on government spending on projects aligned with Maqasid al-Shariah. It requires recognition as expenses when goods or services are received unless a long-lived asset is created, in which case capitalization and depreciation are required. This is consistent with standard accounting practice (FAS 42) and provides transparency regarding socially responsible investments. Drawing on the concept of socially beneficial spending from AAOIFI Governance Standard for Waqf Institutions reinforces the Shariah compliance aspect.\\n\\nFAS7.ACC3: This clause addresses tax policies designed to promote wealth redistribution in accordance with Zakat principles. It requires disclosure of any revenue reduction resulting from such policies and an explanation of their objectives and Shariah alignment. This provides transparency without endorsing Zakat where it's not legally mandated. The link to disclosures around social impact investing in IFRS implementations provides an example of how such policies could be communicated to stakeholders.\\n\\nFAS7.ACC4: This clause addresses government investments structured according to Shariah-compliant principles. It directs users to apply AAOIFI AS 5 and 6, ensuring that Mudarabah and Musharakah investments are accounted for in accordance with established Islamic finance accounting standards. This promotes consistency and comparability in financial reporting for such investments. This addresses the FCIA's gap by ensuring that investments are treated according to their specific structure under Shariah-compliant financing contracts, thereby ensuring compliance.\\n\\nThese clauses are designed to be consistent with both Shariah principles and existing accounting frameworks, providing practical guidance for IFIs while maintaining transparency and comparability in financial reporting.
