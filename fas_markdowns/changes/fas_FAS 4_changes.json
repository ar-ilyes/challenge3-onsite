      "new_paragraph": "*Note: If the standard's requirements contradict the Islamic bank's charter or local laws, this contradiction should be disclosed.*\n\nThis standard also Includes the following clauses:\n\n**FAS4.SH1**: The initial contribution of each partner in a Diminishing Musharaka shall be clearly defined, specifying whether it is in the form of cash, in-kind assets, or a combination thereof. In-kind contributions shall be valued at their fair market value at the time of the contribution, as determined by an independent and qualified valuer acceptable to all partners and approved by the Shariah Supervisory Board. This valuation must be documented transparently and made available to all partners. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12, para 4/2; AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12 on Musharaka, para 4/2)\n\n**FAS4.SH2**: The profit and loss distribution ratio between the partners shall be clearly defined and agreed upon at the inception of the Musharaka. The profit distribution ratio need not be equal to the capital contribution ratio, but the loss distribution ratio must be proportional to the capital contribution ratio, unless otherwise permitted by Shariah principles based on specific justifications approved by the Shariah Supervisory Board. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12, para 6/1)\n\n**FAS4.SH3**: A partner may exit the diminishing Musharaka before its maturity by selling their share to the remaining partner(s) or to a third party, subject to the approval of the Shariah Supervisory Board. The sale price shall be based on the fair market value of the share at the time of exit, as determined by a qualified independent valuer, or a mutually agreed-upon price between the remaining partners and the exiting partner. The method of valuation should be clearly stated in the initial agreement. Any pre-agreed price or formula that guarantees a fixed return above the principal is not permitted. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12, para 7/3; AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12 on Musharaka, para 5/1)\n\n**FAS4.SH4**: If a partner exits by selling their share to the remaining partner(s), the transaction shall be structured as a sale (Bai') and shall comply with all relevant Shariah requirements for sales, including the absence of riba (interest), gharar (uncertainty), and maysir (gambling). The transfer of ownership must be immediate and unconditional. Payment to the exiting partner can be made in cash or in-kind assets, provided that the in-kind assets are valued at their fair market value at the time of transfer and the exiting partner consents to receiving such assets. Any deferred payment arrangements must comply with Shariah principles and avoid any element of riba. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 2, para 3/1; AAOIFI Shariah Standard 2 (Murabaha) regarding the transfer of assets and the avoidance of riba in deferred payments.)\n\n**FAS4.SH5**: In the event of the death or legal incapacity of a partner, their share in the diminishing Musharaka shall devolve to their legal heirs or representatives, subject to Shariah inheritance laws and the terms of the Musharaka agreement. The remaining partner(s) shall have the right of first refusal to purchase the share from the heirs or representatives at its fair market value. The Musharaka agreement shall include a clearly defined dispute resolution mechanism, adhering to Shariah principles, to address any disagreements arising from partner contributions, valuations, exits, or profit/loss distributions. This mechanism may include arbitration by a Shariah-compliant arbitration panel. (ref: Resolution of the Islamic Fiqh Academy No. 30 (4/4); General principle of 'Taswiya al-Khilafat' (resolution of disputes) in Islamic jurisprudence.)\n\n**FAS4.DM.ACC1**: Initial Contributions: Partner contributions to a Diminishing Musharaka (Shirkah al-ʿAqd) shall be recognized at fair value at the date of contribution. Cash contributions are recognized at their nominal amount. In-kind contributions, including properties or other assets, shall be recognized at their fair market value at the date of contribution, as determined by a qualified independent valuer acceptable to all partners and approved by the Shariah Supervisory Board. Any difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of assets contributed by a partner shall be treated as an adjustment to the partner's capital account, reflecting a revaluation gain or loss, consistent with AAOIFI FAS 30 (Investments in Real Estate). If fair value cannot be reliably determined, the contribution shall be recorded at the carrying value of the asset, with appropriate disclosure of the uncertainty in valuation. (ref: AAOIFI AS 12 para 4/2, IFRS 13 (Conceptual Alignment); AAOIFI FAS 30, para 12; AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12, para 4/2)\n\n**FAS4.DM.ACC2**: Profit shall be distributed according to the pre-agreed profit-sharing ratio stipulated in the Musharaka agreement. Losses shall be borne in proportion to the capital contribution ratio, unless a different allocation is permitted by Shariah principles and approved by the Shariah Supervisory Board with appropriate justification, and disclosed in the financial statements. The distribution of profit and losses should be recognized in the period they are earned or incurred, respectively. The Diminishing Musharaka asset shall be measured in accordance with the relevant accounting standards applicable to the nature of the underlying asset (e.g., investment property measured under IAS 40 (as referenced by AAOIFI Accounting Standard 32 where consistent with Shariah) if the asset is real estate, or inventory measured under IAS 2 (as referenced by AAOIFI Accounting Standard 32 where consistent with Shariah) if the asset is inventory). The periodic reduction in the Musharaka share of the partners (through the purchase of the financier's share) shall be accounted for as a reduction in the liability of the Musharaka and a corresponding increase in the equity of the partner purchasing the share. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12, para 6/1; AAOIFI AS 12, IAS 40, IAS 2 (Conceptual Alignment))\n\n**FAS4.DM.ACC3**: Upon a partner's exit from the Diminishing Musharaka (Shirkah al-ʿAqd), the exiting partner's share shall be derecognized from the Musharaka's balance sheet. If the share is sold to the remaining partner(s) or a third party, the transaction shall be accounted for as a sale of an asset. The consideration received shall be recognized as revenue, and any gain or loss on the sale shall be recognized in the profit or loss statement. The exit price shall be determined based on either the fair market value of the exiting partner's share at the time of exit, as determined by an independent valuer, or a mutually agreed-upon price between the remaining partners and the exiting partner. The method used for determining the exit price must be consistently applied and disclosed. The fair value of the share at the time of exit, as determined by a qualified independent valuer, shall be used as the basis for calculating the gain or loss. The exiting partner's share of accumulated profits or losses, determined up to the date of exit according to the agreed-upon profit and loss sharing ratio, shall be settled as part of the exit transaction. (ref: AAOIFI FAS 11, para 23; AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12, para 7/3; AAOIFI AS 12 para 5/1, AAOIFI AS 13 para 3/5)\n\n**FAS4.DM.ACC4**: If a partner exits by selling their share to the remaining partner(s), the remaining partner(s) shall recognize the acquired share at its fair value at the date of acquisition, as determined by a qualified independent valuer. This acquisition increases their ownership stake in the Musharaka, and the corresponding increase in their capital contribution shall be reflected in the equity section of their balance sheet. The transaction must comply with Shariah requirements for sales (Bai'). Payment to the exiting partner may be made in cash or in-kind assets, provided that the in-kind assets are valued at their fair market value at the time of transfer and the exiting partner consents to receiving such assets. If payment is deferred, the terms of the deferred payment arrangement must comply with Shariah principles and avoid any element of riba. The deferred payment arrangement shall be accounted for as a financing transaction, with the present value of the future payments recognized as a liability and the difference between the total payments and the present value recognized as a financing cost, to be amortized over the payment period. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 2, para 3/1; AAOIFI Shariah Standard 2, AAOIFI AS 4)\n\n**FAS4.DM.ACC5**: In the event of the death or legal incapacity of a partner, the share devolving to their legal heirs or representatives shall be treated as a transfer of ownership. The remaining partner(s) have the right of first refusal to purchase the share at its fair market value. If the remaining partner(s) exercise their right, the transaction shall be accounted for as per FAS4.DM.ACC4. If the heirs or representatives retain the share, they become partners in the Musharaka, and their share is recognized at its fair market value at the date of inheritance or legal representation. The financial statements shall disclose the following information related to Diminishing Musharaka arrangements: (a) The nature and purpose of the Diminishing Musharaka. (b) The profit and loss sharing ratio among the partners. (c) The method used for determining the fair value of partner contributions and exits. (d) Any restrictions on the transferability of ownership interests. (e) The amount of assets and liabilities held in the Diminishing Musharaka. (f) Details of any partner exits during the reporting period, including the exit price and the method of payment. (g) The dispute resolution mechanism outlined in the Musharaka agreement. Material transactions with related parties involved in the Musharaka should also be disclosed as per relevant AAOIFI standards.

Any difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of assets contributed by a partner shall be treated as an adjustment to the partner's capital account, reflecting a revaluation gain or loss, consistent with AAOIFI FAS 30 (Investments in Real Estate). If fair value cannot be reliably determined, the contribution shall be recorded at the carrying value of the asset, with appropriate disclosure of the uncertainty in valuation.

The distribution of profit and losses should be recognized in the period they are earned or incurred, respectively. The Diminishing Musharaka asset shall be measured in accordance with the relevant accounting standards applicable to the nature of the underlying asset (e.g., investment property measured under IAS 40 (as referenced by AAOIFI Accounting Standard 32 where consistent with Shariah) if the asset is real estate, or inventory measured under IAS 2 (as referenced by AAOIFI Accounting Standard 32 where consistent with Shariah) if the asset is inventory). The periodic reduction in the Musharaka share of the partners (through the purchase of the financier's share) shall be accounted for as a reduction in the liability of the Musharaka and a corresponding increase in the equity of the partner purchasing the share. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12, para 6/1; AAOIFI AS 12, IAS 40, IAS 2 (Conceptual Alignment))\\n\\n**FAS4.DM.ACC3**: Upon a partner's exit from the Diminishing Musharaka (Shirkah al-ʿAqd), the exiting partner's share shall be derecognized from the Musharaka's balance sheet.

The consideration received shall be recognized as revenue, and any gain or loss on the sale shall be recognized in the profit or loss statement. The exit price shall be determined based on either the fair market value of the exiting partner's share at the time of exit, as determined by an independent valuer, or a mutually agreed-upon price between the remaining partners and the exiting partner. The method used for determining the exit price must be consistently applied and disclosed. The fair value of the share at the time of exit, as determined by a qualified independent valuer, shall be used as the basis for calculating the gain or loss. The exiting partner's share of accumulated profits or losses, determined up to the date of exit according to the agreed-upon profit and loss sharing ratio, shall be settled as part of the exit transaction.

The transaction must comply with Shariah requirements for sales (Bai'). Payment to the exiting partner may be made in cash or in-kind assets, provided that the in-kind assets are valued at their fair market value at the time of transfer and the exiting partner consents to receiving such assets. If payment is deferred, the terms of the deferred payment arrangement must comply with Shariah principles and avoid any element of riba. The deferred payment arrangement shall be accounted for as a financing transaction, with the present value of the future payments recognized as a liability and the difference between the total payments and the present value recognized as a financing cost, to be amortized over the payment period. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 2, para 3/1; AAOIFI Shariah Standard 2, AAOIFI AS 4)\\n\\n**FAS4.DM.ACC5**: In the event of the death or legal incapacity of a partner, the share devolving to their legal heirs or representatives shall be treated as a transfer of ownership.

If the remaining partner(s) exercise their right, the transaction shall be accounted for as per FAS4.DM.ACC4. If the heirs or representatives retain the share, they become partners in the Musharaka, and their share is recognized at its fair market value at the date of inheritance or legal representation. The financial statements shall disclose the following information related to Diminishing Musharaka arrangements: (a) The nature and purpose of the Diminishing Musharaka. (b) The profit and loss sharing ratio among the partners. (c) The method used for determining the fair value of partner contributions and exits. (d) Any restrictions on the transferability of ownership interests. (e) The amount of assets and liabilities held in the Diminishing Musharaka.

In-kind contributions need to be valued by an independent, qualified valuer approved by the Shariah Supervisory Board.  The valuation method must be transparently documented.

The sale price should be based on the fair market value at the time of exit, determined by an independent valuer, or a mutually agreed-upon price. Pre-agreed prices guaranteeing a fixed return above the principal are not allowed. The transaction must comply with Shariah sales principles (Bai'), avoiding riba, gharar, and maysir. Payment can be in cash or in-kind assets valued at fair market value. Deferred payments must adhere to Shariah principles.\\n\\n*   **Death or Incapacity of a Partner (FAS4.SH5, FAS4.DM.ACC5):**  The partner's share devolves to their heirs, subject to Shariah inheritance laws and the Musharaka agreement. Remaining partners have the first right to buy the share at fair market value.\\n\\n*   **Disclosure (FAS4.DM.ACC5):** Financial statements must disclose the nature and purpose of the Musharaka, profit/loss sharing ratios, valuation methods, any transfer restrictions, asset and liability amounts, details of partner exits, and the dispute resolution mechanism.\\n\\n**Why these changes?**\\n\\nThese updates address a significant gap in FAS 4, ensuring Shariah compliance and providing practical guidance for Islamic Financial Institutions, especially in real estate funds using diminishing Musharaka.

In-kind contributions shall be valued at their fair market value at the time of the contribution, as determined by an independent and qualified valuer acceptable to all partners and approved by the Shariah Supervisory Board. This valuation must be documented transparently and made available to all partners. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12, para 4/2; AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12 on Musharaka, para 4/2)\\n\\n**FAS4.SH2**: The profit and loss distribution ratio between the partners shall be clearly defined and agreed upon at the inception of the Musharaka. The profit distribution ratio need not be equal to the capital contribution ratio, but the loss distribution ratio must be proportional to the capital contribution ratio, unless otherwise permitted by Shariah principles based on specific justifications approved by the Shariah Supervisory Board. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12, para 6/1)\\n\\n**FAS4.SH3**: A partner may exit the diminishing Musharaka before its maturity by selling their share to the remaining partner(s) or to a third party, subject to the approval of the Shariah Supervisory Board. The sale price shall be based on the fair market value of the share at the time of exit, as determined by a qualified independent valuer, or a mutually agreed-upon price between the remaining partners and the exiting partner. The method of valuation should be clearly stated in the initial agreement. Any pre-agreed price or formula that guarantees a fixed return above the principal is not permitted. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12, para 7/3; AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12 on Musharaka, para 5/1)\\n\\n**FAS4.SH4**: If a partner exits by selling their share to the remaining partner(s), the transaction shall be structured as a sale (Bai') and shall comply with all relevant Shariah requirements for sales, including the absence of riba (interest), gharar (uncertainty), and maysir (gambling). The transfer of ownership must be immediate and unconditional. Payment to the exiting partner can be made in cash or in-kind assets, provided that the in-kind assets are valued at their fair market value at the time of transfer and the exiting partner consents to receiving such assets. Any deferred payment arrangements must comply with Shariah principles and avoid any element of riba. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 2, para 3/1; AAOIFI Shariah Standard 2 (Murabaha) regarding the transfer of assets and the avoidance of riba in deferred payments.)\\n\\n**FAS4.SH5**: In the event of the death or legal incapacity of a partner, their share in the diminishing Musharaka shall devolve to their legal heirs or representatives, subject to Shariah inheritance laws and the terms of the Musharaka agreement.

Cash contributions are recognized at their nominal amount. In-kind contributions, including properties or other assets, shall be recognized at their fair market value at the date of contribution, as determined by a qualified independent valuer acceptable to all partners and approved by the Shariah Supervisory Board. Any difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of assets contributed by a partner shall be treated as an adjustment to the partner's capital account, reflecting a revaluation gain or loss, consistent with AAOIFI FAS 30 (Investments in Real Estate). If fair value cannot be reliably determined, the contribution shall be recorded at the carrying value of the asset, with appropriate disclosure of the uncertainty in valuation.

The periodic reduction in the Musharaka share of the partners (through the purchase of the financier's share) shall be accounted for as a reduction in the liability of the Musharaka and a corresponding increase in the equity of the partner purchasing the share.

The consideration received shall be recognized as revenue, and any gain or loss on the sale shall be recognized in the profit or loss statement. The exit price shall be determined based on either the fair market value of the exiting partner's share at the time of exit, as determined by an independent valuer, or a mutually agreed-upon price between the remaining partners and the exiting partner. The method used for determining the exit price must be consistently applied and disclosed. The fair value of the share at the time of exit, as determined by a qualified independent valuer, shall be used as the basis for calculating the gain or loss. The exiting partner's share of accumulated profits or losses, determined up to the date of exit according to the agreed-upon profit and loss sharing ratio, shall be settled as part of the exit transaction.

This acquisition increases their ownership stake in the Musharaka, and the corresponding increase in their capital contribution shall be reflected in the equity section of their balance sheet. The transaction must comply with Shariah requirements for sales (Bai'). Payment to the exiting partner may be made in cash or in-kind assets, provided that the in-kind assets are valued at their fair market value at the time of transfer and the exiting partner consents to receiving such assets. If payment is deferred, the terms of the deferred payment arrangement must comply with Shariah principles and avoid any element of riba. The deferred payment arrangement shall be accounted for as a financing transaction, with the present value of the future payments recognized as a liability and the difference between the total payments and the present value recognized as a financing cost, to be amortized over the payment period.

The remaining partner(s) have the right of first refusal to purchase the share at its fair market value. If the remaining partner(s) exercise their right, the transaction shall be accounted for as per FAS4.DM.ACC4. If the heirs or representatives retain the share, they become partners in the Musharaka, and their share is recognized at its fair market value at the date of inheritance or legal representation. The financial statements shall disclose the following information related to Diminishing Musharaka arrangements: (a) The nature and purpose of the Diminishing Musharaka. (b) The profit and loss sharing ratio among the partners. (c) The method used for determining the fair value of partner contributions and exits.
