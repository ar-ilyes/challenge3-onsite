A clearly defined and consistently applied valuation method is required. In-kind contributions need independent evaluation, and any difference between book value and fair value is treated according to Shariah principles.\\n*   **Diminishing Ownership:** The gradual transfer of ownership must respect Shariah principles. The pricing and timing of transfers should be clearly defined to avoid riba (interest) or gharar (uncertainty). Diminishing shares are treated as a sale of ownership, priced using a transparent, consistent, and fair methodology.\\n*   **Partner Exits:** A partner can exit by selling their share to the remaining partners at a fair value or by selling the underlying asset and distributing proceeds. The agreement must specify how fair value is determined, considering market conditions and profit/loss sharing ratios. Any capital gain or loss is allocated according to the agreed profit/loss sharing ratio. When a partner exits, the remaining partners purchase the exiting partner's share at a price determined by the pre-agreed valuation method, documented as a sale and purchase agreement.\\n*   **Profit Distribution:** Profit is distributed based on partners' ownership at the time of distribution, reflecting their capital contribution.\\n*   **Accounting Treatment:** In-kind contributions are independently evaluated. Differences between book value and fair value are recognized as revaluation gains or losses. The method of exit must be disclosed. Gains or losses from the sale of shares or assets are allocated per the profit/loss sharing ratio. For real estate funds, underlying real estate assets are accounted for using standards applicable to real estate (e.g., IAS 40, if Shariah-compliant).\\n*   **Disclosures:** The Diminishing Musharaka agreement must be disclosed, including partner names, duration, profit/loss sharing ratio, valuation methods, and other significant terms.

The pricing and timing of transfers should be clearly defined to avoid riba (interest) or gharar (uncertainty). Diminishing shares are treated as a sale of ownership, priced using a transparent, consistent, and fair methodology.\\n*   **Partner Exits:** A partner can exit by selling their share to the remaining partners at a fair value or by selling the underlying asset and distributing proceeds. The agreement must specify how fair value is determined, considering market conditions and profit/loss sharing ratios. Any capital gain or loss is allocated according to the agreed profit/loss sharing ratio. When a partner exits, the remaining partners purchase the exiting partner's share at a price determined by the pre-agreed valuation method, documented as a sale and purchase agreement.\\n*   **Profit Distribution:** Profit is distributed based on partners' ownership at the time of distribution, reflecting their capital contribution.\\n*   **Accounting Treatment:** In-kind contributions are independently evaluated. Differences between book value and fair value are recognized as revaluation gains or losses. The method of exit must be disclosed. Gains or losses from the sale of shares or assets are allocated per the profit/loss sharing ratio. For real estate funds, underlying real estate assets are accounted for using standards applicable to real estate (e.g., IAS 40, if Shariah-compliant).\\n*   **Disclosures:** The Diminishing Musharaka agreement must be disclosed, including partner names, duration, profit/loss sharing ratio, valuation methods, and other significant terms. The valuation methodology used for determining the price of the diminishing share must be disclosed.\\n\\nThese changes incorporate Shariah principles and accounting standards to ensure fairness, transparency, and compliance in Diminishing Musharaka transactions.
