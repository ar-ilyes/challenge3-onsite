This ensures fair compensation and prevents unjust enrichment. Gains or losses from the exit are allocated according to the agreed profit and loss sharing ratio.\\n*   **Real Estate Funds:** For real estate funds using diminishing Musharaka, the underlying properties need to be valued regularly (at least annually) by an independent valuer, with Shariah advisor oversight.\\n*   **Prohibition of Guaranteed Returns:** Agreements that guarantee a fixed value for an exiting partner's share, regardless of the market, are not allowed as they resemble *riba* (interest).\\n*   **Transparency and Disclosure:** The financial statements need to disclose details about the Musharaka arrangement, valuation methods, gains or losses on partner exits, and other relevant information.\\n\\nThese changes aim to provide clear guidance for Islamic Financial Institutions, ensuring consistent and Shariah-compliant accounting practices for diminishing Musharaka, especially in the context of real estate funds.

This ensures everyone starts on a level playing field.\\n*   **Profit and Loss Distribution:** The way profits and losses are shared must be clearly defined in the Musharaka agreement. Any changes to this ratio need to be Shariah-compliant and approved by the Shariah Supervisory Board.\\n*   **Partner Exits:** When a partner exits, the settlement should be based on the fair market value of their share at the time of exit, as determined by an independent valuer or a Shariah-compliant pre-agreed mechanism. This ensures fair compensation and prevents unjust enrichment. Gains or losses from the exit are allocated according to the agreed profit and loss sharing ratio.\\n*   **Real Estate Funds:** For real estate funds using diminishing Musharaka, the underlying properties need to be valued regularly (at least annually) by an independent valuer, with Shariah advisor oversight.\\n*   **Prohibition of Guaranteed Returns:** Agreements that guarantee a fixed value for an exiting partner's share, regardless of the market, are not allowed as they resemble *riba* (interest).\\n*   **Transparency and Disclosure:** The financial statements need to disclose details about the Musharaka arrangement, valuation methods, gains or losses on partner exits, and other relevant information.\\n\\nThese changes aim to provide clear guidance for Islamic Financial Institutions, ensuring consistent and Shariah-compliant accounting practices for diminishing Musharaka, especially in the context of real estate funds.
