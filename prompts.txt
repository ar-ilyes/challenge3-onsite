Budget reconciliation bill fails to move out of Budget Committee:On May 16, 2025, a significant budget reconciliation bill in the United States failed to advance from the Budget Committee. The bill, which included tax provisions recently approved by the House Ways and Means Committee, was blocked by a coalition of Republican fiscal conservatives and Democrats. The primary concerns cited were the bill’s overall cost and its projected impact on federal deficits. This development signals ongoing political gridlock in U.S. fiscal policy and raises uncertainty over the future of proposed tax changes and extensions, including those related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) ([Journal of Accountancy](https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/)).one fas gap analyzer agent prompt

The valuation method shall be agreed upon by all partners and comply with Shariah principles. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12: Sharika (Participation) para 4/2, AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12 on Musharaka, clause 3/1)\n*   **Transfer of Ownership:** The diminishing partner\u2019s acquisition of the other partner's share in the asset must be structured as a sale, lease or a combination of both (Ijarah wa Iqtina). Each transfer of ownership must reflect a genuine sale and purchase, with the price determined at the time of transfer and based on the then prevailing fair market value of the portion being transferred. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12: Sharika (Participation) para 4/6, AAOIFI Shariah Standard 9: Ijarah and Ijarah Muntahia Bittamleek, AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12 on Musharaka, clause 5/2)\n*   **Partner Exit:** Upon the exit of a partner from the diminishing Musharaka, the transaction shall be structured either as a purchase of the exiting partner's share by the remaining partner(s) or as a sale of the entire asset to a third party. The valuation of the exiting partner's share shall be determined at the time of exit, either through mutual agreement or based on a pre-agreed mechanism that complies with Shariah principles. The exiting partner is entitled to their share of the asset's value based on their ownership percentage at the time of exit, after deducting any liabilities attributable to their share. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12: Sharika (Participation) para 4/5, AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12 on Musharaka, clause 7/2)\n*   **Equity Positions:** The accounting treatment for the diminishing Musharaka shall reflect the changing equity positions of the partners. Contributions shall be recorded as equity investments, and the transfer of ownership shares shall be recorded as a reduction in one partner's equity and an increase in the other partner's equity, based on the agreed-upon transaction price. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12: Sharika (Participation) para 6/1)\n*   **Profit Distribution:** Any profits generated by the Musharaka shall be distributed among the partners according to the agreed-upon profit-sharing ratio. Losses shall be borne according to the capital contribution ratio, unless otherwise agreed upon, provided such agreement does not violate Shariah principles regarding fairness and justice. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12: Sharika (Participation) para 5/1)\n*   **Sale Proceeds:** The proceeds from the sale of the exiting partner's share or the entire asset shall be distributed among the partners according to their respective ownership percentages at the time of exit, after settling any outstanding debts or obligations related to the Musharaka venture. Any profit or loss arising from the sale shall be distributed according to the profit-sharing ratio agreed upon in the Musharaka contract, unless the loss is due to negligence by one of the partners.

Initial Contributions to Diminishing Musharaka:**\n\n*   Initial contributions to a Diminishing Musharaka (Shirkah al-\u02bfAqd) shall be recognized as investments in the Musharaka venture. The carrying amount of each partner's investment shall be determined based on the fair value of the contributed asset at the inception of the contract, reflecting the agreed ownership percentage. This fair value must be mutually agreed upon and documented transparently. For contributions in-kind, an independent valuation, acceptable to all partners and compliant with Shariah principles, must be obtained. The nature of the contribution (cash or in-kind) and its fair value shall be disclosed. Any difference between the carrying amount and the fair value shall be treated in accordance with FAS [Relevant standard on fair value measurement, if any, or refer to IFRS 13 if no directly applicable FAS exists, stating that IFRS 13 is used only as guidance in this specific area].

Subsequent Transfers of Ownership in Diminishing Musharaka:**\n\n*   Subsequent transfers of ownership in a diminishing Musharaka, representing the periodic acquisition of a portion of another partner's share, shall be accounted for as purchases of equity interests. The acquiring partner shall increase their investment balance by the purchase price, and the selling partner shall decrease their investment balance by the same amount. The purchase price shall be based on the current fair value or another mutually agreed-upon and Shariah-compliant valuation method at the time of the transfer. The periodic transfer of ownership in a Diminishing Musharaka shall be accounted for as a sale of a portion of the asset by the selling partner and a purchase of the same portion by the acquiring partner. The transaction price shall be recognized as a reduction in the selling partner's equity and a corresponding increase in the acquiring partner's equity. Any gain or loss arising from this transfer shall be recognized in the profit or loss statement in the period of the transfer. Gains or losses are only recognized when a partner exits the Musharaka completely. (ref: AAOIFI AS 12 para 4/6, IFRS 15 (revenue recognition principles conceptually applied to the 'sale' element); AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12, para 5/2)\n\n**3. Partner's Exit from Diminishing Musharaka:**\n\n*   Upon a partner's exit from a diminishing Musharaka, the transaction shall be accounted for as either a sale of the partner's remaining interest to the other partner(s) or a sale of the entire Musharaka asset to a third party. The proceeds from the sale, net of any direct selling costs, shall be allocated to the exiting partner based on their ownership percentage at the time of exit, after settling any outstanding dues related to the Musharaka. The asset shall be valued at its fair value at the date of exit. The exiting partner's share of the asset's fair value, net of any liabilities attributable to their share, shall be derecognized from the equity of the exiting partner and recognized as a payable. The remaining partners' equity shall be adjusted accordingly to reflect their revised ownership percentages. Any resulting gain or loss shall be recognized in the profit or loss statement of the exiting partner, calculated as the difference between the net proceeds received and the carrying amount of their investment in the Musharaka at the date of exit. (ref: AAOIFI AS 12 para 4/5, FAS 4 (general principles of equity accounting upon liquidation/exit); AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12, para 7/2 & 7/3)\n\n**4. Real Estate Classification in Diminishing Musharaka:**\n\n*   For diminishing Musharaka structures involving real estate, the classification of the real estate asset (e.g., as investment property or property, plant, and equipment) should be determined based on the intention of the Musharaka. If the real estate is held for rental income or capital appreciation, it should be classified as investment property and measured according to FAS [Relevant standard on Investment Property or, in its absence, IAS 40 as guidance]. If the real estate is used in the ordinary course of business, it should be classified as property, plant, and equipment and measured according to FAS [Relevant standard on PP&E or, in its absence, IAS 16 as guidance]. At each reporting date, the carrying amount of the asset under Diminishing Musharaka shall be reviewed for impairment in accordance with applicable impairment standards. Any impairment loss shall be allocated between the partners based on their respective ownership percentages at the time of the impairment assessment. (ref: IAS 40 (Investment Property) - Guidance Only; IAS 16 (Property, Plant and Equipment) - Guidance Only, IAS 36 (Impairment of Assets) - applied with consideration of ownership percentages.)\n\n**5. Profit and Loss Distribution in Diminishing Musharaka:**\n\n*   Profits generated from the Diminishing Musharaka shall be distributed according to the agreed-upon profit-sharing ratio, as outlined in the Musharaka agreement. Losses shall be borne according to the capital contribution ratio, unless otherwise agreed upon in a manner that is Shariah-compliant. The profit/loss distribution shall be reflected as a reduction in equity for the distributing party and an increase in equity for the receiving party. (ref: AAOIFI AS 12 para 5/1)\n\n**6. Disclosure for Diminishing Musharaka Arrangements:**\n\n*   The financial statements shall disclose the following information relating to Diminishing Musharaka arrangements: (a) the nature and purpose of the Diminishing Musharaka; (b) the agreed-upon profit-sharing ratio; (c) the method used to value contributions in-kind; (d) the terms and conditions for the transfer of ownership shares; (e) the carrying amount of the investments in the Musharaka; (f) any restrictions on the transfer of assets within the Musharaka; (g) the amount of any gains or losses recognized upon the exit of partners from the Musharaka; (h) any commitments related to future contributions or acquisitions of ownership interests within the Musharaka; and (i) significant events related to the Diminishing Musharaka during the reporting period, such as transfers of ownership or partner exits. (ref: FAS 4 (general disclosure requirements), AAOIFI AS 12 (disclosure requirements as guiding principle.), IFRS 12 (Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities) - Conceptual Alignment for Disclosure Requirements)",
