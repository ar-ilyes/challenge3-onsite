# Final Verdict on FAS Analysis

## Overall Verdict
**FAS Standards to Update:** FAS_4, FAS_7, FAS_10, FAS_28, FAS_32
**Need for New FAS Standard:** No, a new FAS standard is not indicated at this time.

### Overall Justification:
The analysis indicates that multiple FAS, particularly FAS 4, lack adequate guidance on the treatment of partner contributions and exits in diminishing Musharaka structures.

### Overall Chain of Thought:
1. Reviewed the context regarding diminishing Musharaka and its implications for partner contributions and exits. 2. Analyzed the findings from various FAS analyses, noting the consistent identification of gaps in FAS 4 and related standards. 3. Concluded that the existing FAS can be updated to provide the necessary guidance, rather than creating a new standard.

#### Referenced Gaps (Supporting Overall Verdict):
- FAS 4 does not provide guidance on the treatment of partner contributions and exits in diminishing Musharaka structures.
- Lack of clarity on exit strategies for partners in diminishing Musharaka as per FAS 4.
