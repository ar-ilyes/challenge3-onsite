      "justification": "The context indicates a growing use of diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds, yet states that FAS 4 does not cover shirkah al-ʿaqd structures. This absence suggests a significant gap in the accounting treatment for such partnerships, particularly regarding contributions and exits, which are critical for accurately reflecting financial positions and performance.",

      "chain_of_thought": "My step-by-step reasoning: 1. Reviewed context for details on diminishing Musharaka use in real estate. 2. Identified that it mentions FAS 4's lack of coverage for shirkah al-ʿaqd. 3. Considered implications for partner contributions and exits. 4. Concluded there is a significant gap due to the lack of guidance.",
