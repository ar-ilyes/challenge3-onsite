  "change_summary": "Based on your questions about Diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds, we've updated FAS 4 to provide more specific guidance.\n\nHere's what changed:\n\n*   **Valuation:** We added new clauses (FAS4.SH14.1, FAS4.SH14.2, FAS4.DM.ACC14.1, FAS4.DM.ACC14.2) that require annual valuations by independent appraisers for real estate assets in Diminishing Musharaka. Fluctuations in value will now impact both the IFI's and the client's equity based on their ownership percentages. This ensures fair adjustments to rental payments and purchase prices, reflecting real economic changes.\n\n*   **Disclosure:** We've expanded disclosure requirements (FAS4.SH17.1, FAS4.SH17.2, FAS4.DM.ACC17.1) to cover how transfer prices are determined, especially during partner exits. This includes disclosing the valuation methods used, the appraiser's qualifications, and the rationale for any premiums or discounts applied. This enhances transparency and fairness.\n\n*   **Shirkah al-ʿAqd Principles:** We've included clauses (FAS4.SH18.1, FAS4.SH18.2, FAS4.SH18.3, FAS4.DM.ACC18.1, FAS4.DM.ACC18.2) to address Shirkah al-ʿAqd aspects. These require clear documentation of capital contributions, agreed-upon profit and loss distribution ratios, and the mechanism for the gradual transfer of ownership, ensuring compliance with Shariah principles and preventing riba or gharar.\n\nThese changes aim to provide clearer accounting and Shariah guidance for Diminishing Musharaka transactions in real estate, particularly regarding valuation, disclosure, and adherence to Shirkah al-ʿAqd principles. We've also updated references to include relevant AAOIFI standards and IFRS for Diminishing Musharaka treatment.",

          "issue": "Lack of specific guidance on the valuation of real estate assets within a diminishing Musharaka structure, particularly concerning the impact of fluctuating property values on partner equity and profit distribution.",
          "justification": "Diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds involves ongoing transfers of ownership from the IFI to the client. FAS 4 addresses investment valuation generally, but it doesn't detail how to account for the unique characteristics of diminishing Musharaka, where the IFI's ownership stake diminishes over time. The standard is unclear on how fluctuations in real estate values affect the periodic 'rental' payments or the client's acquisition of the asset, potentially leading to non-Shariah compliant profit recognition and distribution. This is significant since incorrect valuation can misrepresent the true financial performance of the Musharaka and violate principles of just profit-sharing."

          "issue": "Insufficient disclosure requirements regarding the methodology for determining the transfer price of ownership shares in diminishing Musharaka agreements within real estate funds, especially during partner exits.",
          "justification": "The user context highlights concerns surrounding partner contributions and exits within a diminishing Musharaka structure. FAS 4's disclosure requirements are general and might not adequately capture the complexities of determining the fair value of the remaining IFI's share in the real estate asset when a partner exits. Specifically, the current standards lack clarity on disclosing the valuation methods used when pricing the IFI's share, which is vital for transparency and ensuring that the exit price is Shariah-compliant and equitable to all parties. This is particularly crucial in real estate, where valuation can be subjective and open to manipulation."

          "justification": "The application of diminishing Musharaka utilizes shirkah al-ʿaqd (partnership contract) principles, which require clarity on capital contributions, profit/loss allocation based on agreed ratios, and transparent mechanisms for transferring ownership over time. FAS 4's general treatment of investments doesn't sufficiently address these critical aspects specific to shirkah al-ʿaqd within a diminishing Musharaka framework. Without explicit guidelines, inconsistencies in application and interpretation can lead to Shariah non-compliance, especially related to impermissible gharar (uncertainty) and riba (interest) if the diminishing ownership and associated payments are not structured correctly."

Fluctuations in value will now impact both the IFI's and the client's equity based on their ownership percentages.

This includes disclosing the valuation methods used, the appraiser's qualifications, and the rationale for any premiums or discounts applied. This enhances transparency and fairness.\n\n*   **Shirkah al-ʿAqd Principles:** We've included clauses (FAS4.SH18.1, FAS4.SH18.2, FAS4.SH18.3, FAS4.DM.ACC18.1, FAS4.DM.ACC18.2) to address Shirkah al-ʿAqd aspects. These require clear documentation of capital contributions, agreed-upon profit and loss distribution ratios, and the mechanism for the gradual transfer of ownership, ensuring compliance with Shariah principles and preventing riba or gharar.\n\nThese changes aim to provide clearer accounting and Shariah guidance for Diminishing Musharaka transactions in real estate, particularly regarding valuation, disclosure, and adherence to Shirkah al-ʿAqd principles.

This aligns with Shariah Standard 12 and IFRS 13 (for conceptual guidance on fair value) and ensures that the 'rental' payments and purchase price adjustments reflect the real economic changes in the asset's value. It is consistent with the SPIA Shariah clauses FAS4.SH14.1 and FAS4.SH14.2.\n*   **FAS4.DM.ACC17.1** expands the disclosure requirements of FAS 4, Clause 17, by requiring detailed information on the valuation methodology, appraiser qualifications, adjustment processes, profit/loss ratios, and the valuation of the IFI's share during partner exits. This enhances transparency, as emphasized in AAOIFI Governance Standard 2 and supports the SPIA shariah clauses FAS4.SH17.1 and FAS4.SH17.2.\n*   **FAS4.DM.ACC18.1 and FAS4.DM.ACC18.2** address the Shirkah al-ʿAqd aspect by requiring clear documentation and valuation of initial capital contributions and specifying the accounting treatment for the periodic transfer of ownership. These clauses are based on AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12 and AAOIFI Accounting Standard 1 and reflect the principle of substance over form. This supports the SPIA shariah clauses FAS4.SH18.1, FAS4.SH18.2 and FAS4.SH18.3.\n\nThese clauses are designed to be practically applicable for IFIs by providing clear guidance on accounting for Diminishing Musharaka transactions in real estate while adhering to Shariah principles and relevant accounting standards.",
