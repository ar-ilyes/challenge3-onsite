  "change_summary": "The changes to FAS 4 address how to account for diminishing Musharaka, specifically in real estate funds. Key updates focus on:\n\n*   **Valuation of Real Estate Assets:** Requires fair market value assessment by an independent, Shariah-compliant expert, both initially and periodically, reflecting changing ownership.\n*   **In-Kind Contributions:** Mandates fair market value recognition for real estate contributions, agreed upon by all partners and approved by the Shariah Supervisory Board (SSB).\n*   **Early Exit/Termination:** Specifies asset distribution based on ownership percentages at termination, with gains/losses shared according to the agreed profit and loss ratio.\n*   **Profit Distribution:** Emphasizes SSB approval of profit distribution policies, ensuring returns are solely from ownership share and profit-sharing, not fixed interest.\n*   **Rental Rate Increases:** Justification of increases in rental rate during the Musharaka period with a reasonable benchmark reflecting market conditions.\n*   **Shariah Compliance:** Reinforces the SSB's role in ensuring Shariah compliance of valuation methods and accounting practices.\n*   **Disclosures:** Requires detailed disclosures in financial statements about the Musharaka arrangement, valuation methods, ownership percentages, and Shariah compliance.\n\nThese changes aim to provide clear guidance, ensure fairness, and align accounting practices with Shariah principles, particularly concerning the avoidance of Riba (interest) and Gharar (uncertainty). Several clauses have been added to FAS 4 and are numbered FAS4.SH1 to FAS4.SH6 and FAS4.DM.ACC1 to FAS4.DM.ACC6.",

          "justification": "In diminishing Musharaka for real estate funds, the ownership of the asset gradually transfers from the IFI to the client. FAS 4, which addresses investment accounting, doesn't provide sufficient guidance on how to value the real estate asset as the partnership evolves, specifically concerning the implications of diminishing ownership for both the IFI and the other partner. This is a critical gap because accurately reflecting the changing economic reality is essential for fair financial reporting and Shariah compliance. The standard needs to clarify how to account for the periodic transfer of ownership and its impact on the asset's carrying value and the recognition of profit or loss."

          "justification": "FAS 4 provides general guidance on investment accounting, but it doesn't delve into the specific complexities of partner contributions and withdrawals in a diminishing Musharaka. Real estate funds often involve in-kind contributions of property. The standard lacks specific rules on how to determine the fair value of these contributions and how they should be treated in the IFI's financial statements. Furthermore, the standard is silent on the accounting treatment for early exits or termination of the Musharaka, particularly concerning the distribution of assets and the recognition of any gains or losses. This omission can lead to inconsistent accounting practices among IFIs."

This should cover scenarios where the asset's value has appreciated or depreciated. 4) Explicitly incorporate Shariah compliance principles into the application of accounting standards, particularly regarding valuation methods and profit distribution, ensuring the avoidance of riba (interest) and gharar (uncertainty).

This ensures equitable treatment of contributions (FAS4.Musharaka.ACC2). 3. **Distributions upon early termination/exit:** This ensures distributions follow ownership percentages at termination and aligns with the profit/loss sharing ratio, preventing riba (FAS4.Musharaka.ACC3). The principle is derived from AAOIFI AS 12 regarding Musharaka profit distributions. 4. **Profit distribution policy:** It explicitly requires SSB approval and adherence to Shariah principles, prohibiting fixed/predetermined returns (FAS4.Musharaka.ACC4). AAOIFI AS 12 serves as a basis. 5. **Valuation method approval by SSB:** This ensures the valuation methodology used complies with Shariah and avoids gharar and riba (FAS4.Musharaka.ACC5), drawing from AAOIFI Governance Standards on SSB roles. The accounting logic is designed to reflect the economic substance of the diminishing Musharaka while adhering strictly to Shariah principles.

This aligns with FAS XX (Placeholder) for fair value measurement and FAS YY (Placeholder) for impairment testing, ensuring consistency with existing accounting standards while reflecting the diminishing ownership stake of the IFI as required by AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12, para 4/5. The use of an independent valuer addresses concerns regarding subjective valuation, promoting transparency.\n*   **In-Kind Contributions (FAS4.DM.ACC2):** Clause FAS4.DM.ACC2 addresses the accounting for in-kind contributions, requiring fair value at the time of contribution, supported by an independent valuation report. This aligns with AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12, para 4/3, and adopts the principles from FAS ZZ (Placeholder) regarding contributions to partnerships/joint ventures for the treatment of any difference between fair value and carrying amount.\n*   **Early Exit and Termination (FAS4.DM.ACC3):** Clause FAS4.DM.ACC3 addresses the accounting for early exit or termination, emphasizing distribution based on ownership percentages and proportional allocation of gains/losses. This aligns with AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12, para 6/1, and adopts the principles of derecognition from FAS AA (Placeholder) and AAOIFI AS 3.\n*   **Profit Distribution (FAS4.DM.ACC4):** Clause FAS4.DM.ACC4 provides guidance on profit distribution, emphasizing the pre-agreed ratio based on the diminishing ownership stake, adhering to AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12, para 5/2, and ensuring avoidance of riba and gharar.\n*   **Rental Rate Increases (FAS4.DM.ACC5):** Clause FAS4.DM.ACC5 provides guidance on justified increases in rental rates, emphasizing reasonable benchmarks and agreement by both parties. It refers to FAS BB (Placeholder) for lease accounting and AAOIFI AS 23 for Ijarah contracts to the extent applicable and adheres to AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12, para 5/4.\n*   **Disclosure Requirements (FAS4.DM.ACC6):** Clause FAS4.DM.ACC6 outlines comprehensive disclosure requirements, encompassing the nature of the arrangement, contributions, profit distribution, valuation methodology, ownership percentages, and sensitivity analysis, drawing upon AAOIFI AS 1.\n\nThe clauses address the specific gaps identified by FCIA by providing detailed rules for the accounting treatment of diminishing Musharaka transactions, ensuring consistency with both Shariah principles and existing accounting frameworks (FAS, AAOIFI). The references to existing FAS provisions (indicated with placeholders) allow for seamless integration with the current FAS framework.

The portion of the asset owned by the Islamic Financial Institution (IFI) shall be valued based on its proportionate ownership. The valuation methodology must be transparent, disclosed, clearly documented and consistently applied, considering the prevailing market rates and specific characteristics of the property. This valuation shall be updated periodically (at least annually or upon a significant change in market conditions), reflecting the transfers of ownership to the client. Changes in ownership percentages shall be reflected in the accounting records, with a corresponding adjustment to the asset's carrying value and recognition of profit or loss for each party, consistent with their respective ownership stakes. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12, para 4/5, AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12, Principle of Istihsan and Maslahah, principle of 'adalah (justice) in valuation)\n\nFAS4.SH2: In-kind contributions of real estate from partners shall be valued at their fair market value at the time of contribution, as determined by an independent and Shariah-compliant valuation expert approved by the SSB. The valuation methodology shall be clearly documented and consistently applied. The fair market value must be agreed upon by all partners before the contribution is recognized. The IFI shall record the in-kind contribution as an asset at its fair value and recognize the corresponding equity or investment account for the partner. Any subsequent changes in the value of the contributed asset shall be allocated between the partners based on their respective ownership percentages. This value shall be the basis for determining the partner's initial ownership percentage. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12, para 4/3, AAOIFI Shariah Standard 13, Principle of 'Adl (Justice) and Ihsan (Benevolence), Principle of avoiding gharar (uncertainty) in valuation)\n\nFAS4.SH3: Upon early exit or termination of the diminishing Musharaka, the distribution of assets shall be based on the ownership percentages at the time of termination, after deducting any outstanding liabilities. Any gains or losses arising from the sale of the asset shall be distributed according to the agreed profit and loss sharing ratio in the Musharaka agreement, ensuring no guaranteed profit for either party that could be construed as riba. The distribution mechanism must be clearly defined in the Musharaka agreement, ensuring fairness and transparency and compliance with Shariah principles preventing unjust enrichment (akhl al-batil), reflecting the accumulated payments made by the client and any appreciation or depreciation in the value of the underlying asset. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12, para 6/1, principle of avoiding unjust enrichment (akhl al-batil), AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12, Principle of avoiding Riba)\n\nFAS4.SH4: The profit distribution scheme in a diminishing Musharaka must be approved by the IFI's SSB. The scheme shall ensure that the IFI's return is derived solely from its ownership share and profit-sharing arrangement and not from any fixed or predetermined interest-based income. Valuation methods and profit distribution schemes that involve riba (interest) or excessive gharar (uncertainty) are strictly prohibited. The SSB shall provide a written attestation confirming the Shariah compliance of the accounting practices.

Any method that introduces undue speculation or guarantees a fixed return is not permissible. Any increase in the rental rate during the musharaka period should be justified with reasonable benchmark, reflecting market conditions and must be agreed by both parties.

Subsequent measurement shall follow the principles outlined in FAS XX, considering the diminishing ownership stake of the Islamic Financial Institution (IFI). The valuation method should be consistently applied and disclosed in the financial statements, along with the SSB's approval and including the name of the independent appraiser. Subsequent measurement shall reflect the IFI's proportionate ownership share, which changes as the customer's ownership increases through periodic payments. Changes in ownership percentages shall be accounted for by adjusting the carrying amount of the asset and recognizing the corresponding profit or loss for each partner based on their respective ownership percentages. Impairment losses should be recognized if the fair value falls below the carrying amount, in accordance with AAOIFI Financial Accounting Standard 11 'Impairment and Credit Losses' and FAS YY (refer to existing impairment guidance within FAS).

Disclosure should include the nature of the in-kind contribution, the valuation method used, and the carrying amount in the contributing partner's books if different from the fair value. The IFI shall record the asset at fair value and credit the partner's equity or investment account. Subsequent changes in fair value shall be allocated to each partner based on their ownership percentage at the reporting date. Any difference between the fair value of the contributed asset and its previous carrying amount in the contributor's books (if applicable) should be recognized as a gain or loss in the contributor's financial statements, consistent with the principles of fair value accounting.

Any gain or loss arising from the termination shall be allocated among the partners according to their respective ownership percentages, considering accumulated payments and any appreciation or depreciation in the value of the underlying asset. Any predetermined or fixed return to the IFI, regardless of the actual profit or loss, is prohibited and should not be accounted for as part of the profit distribution. The accounting treatment should reflect the substance of the termination agreement, ensuring all assets and liabilities related to the Musharaka are derecognized from the IFI's books, aligning with the principles of derecognition as outlined in FAS AA (refer to existing derecognition guidance within FAS) and AAOIFI AS 3.

The IFI's Shariah Supervisory Board (SSB) must review and approve the valuation methods and profit distribution schemes used in diminishing Musharaka arrangements. The SSB shall provide a written attestation confirming the Shariah compliance of the accounting practices. This attestation shall be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements. Any valuation methods or profit distribution schemes deemed non-compliant with Shariah principles must be rectified before the financial statements are finalized. Disclosure is required of the profit distribution policy and any material changes thereto. (ref: AAOIFI AS 12, paragraph 5/5, AAOIFI Governance Standard 2)\n\nFAS4.DM.ACC5: Any increase in the rental rate during the Musharaka period must be justified by reasonable benchmarks reflecting market conditions, as independently assessed and agreed upon by both parties at the inception of the increase.
