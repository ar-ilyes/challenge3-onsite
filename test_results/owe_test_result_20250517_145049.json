  "change_summary": "We've updated FAS 4 to provide more specific guidance on how to account for diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds using *shirkah al-ʿaqd* structures. This mainly addresses concerns about partner contributions and exits that weren't clearly covered before.\n\nHere's what's new:\n\n*   **Revaluation:** We've added rules for how to periodically revalue the real estate assets in these funds. An independent valuer needs to do this at least annually, and any gains or losses are shared based on the partners' ownership at the time.\n*   **Partner Exits:** The update clarifies how to handle situations where a partner wants to leave the *shirkah al-ʿaqd* before the end of the agreement. It covers valuation of their units and how profits or losses are allocated up to their exit date.\n*   **Illiquid Assets:** Because real estate can be hard to value, especially when market data is scarce, we've outlined acceptable valuation methods like discounted cash flow (DCF) and income capitalization. These must be applied consistently and transparently.\n*   **Disclosures:** There are now expanded disclosure requirements.\n\nThese changes are designed to ensure fairness, transparency, and compliance with Shariah principles, drawing on AAOIFI standards and, where relevant, IFRS. They provide a more comprehensive framework for accounting for diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds, addressing gaps in the previous guidance.",

          "justification": "The user context highlights diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds. FAS 4, while covering general investment accounting, does not address the unique accounting challenges of diminishing Musharaka where the ownership and profit/loss sharing ratios change over time. Specifically, the standard lacks clarity on how to account for the periodic transfer of ownership units and related revaluations in the context of real estate funds using shirkah al-ʿaqd structures. This can lead to inconsistent accounting practices and difficulty in comparing the financial performance of different Islamic real estate funds using diminishing Musharaka."

          "justification": "The user context mentions questions regarding partner exits. FAS 4 covers disposal of investments generally, but it doesn't specifically address the complexities of a partner exiting a shirkah al-ʿaqd structure in a real estate fund. The exit might involve selling the partner's units back to the fund, to other partners, or to a third party. The standard lacks specific rules on how to determine the fair value of these units at the time of exit, how to allocate any resulting gains or losses, and how to ensure that the exit is Shariah-compliant (e.g., avoiding riba). This is a gap because different exit mechanisms could lead to vastly different reported financial results under the current FAS 4, making it difficult to assess the true economic substance of the transaction and the financial health of the fund."

Clause FAS4.DM.ACC2 provides guidance on the subsequent revaluation of the real estate asset, emphasizing the need for independent valuation and allocation of gains or losses based on ownership ratios, adhering to the diminishing nature of the IFI's share.

While IFRS provides guidance on fair value measurement (IFRS 13), its direct application may conflict with Shariah principles; therefore, AAOIFI standards take precedence, with IFRS principles being considered only where they do not contradict Shariah requirements.

The increase or decrease in the asset's value should be allocated between the IFI and the customer according to their ownership ratios at the time of revaluation. Any resulting profit or loss should be recognized according to Shariah principles of profit and loss sharing in Musharaka.\n2.  **Partner Exits from Shirkah al-ʿAqd:** When a partner exits, the valuation of their units should be determined based on the fair value of the underlying real estate assets at the time of exit. This valuation should be conducted by an independent appraiser acceptable to all partners or through a mechanism agreed upon in the Musharaka agreement, ensuring transparency and fairness. Any gains or losses realized upon the exit should be allocated to the exiting partner in proportion to their ownership share at the time of exit, following the principles of *wakala* if a *wakil* is used to sell their share on their behalf. Exit mechanisms must strictly avoid riba.\n3.  **Valuation Methodologies for Illiquid Real Estate:** When market data is limited, valuation methodologies should prioritize discounted cash flow analysis (DCF) or similar techniques, subject to Shariah compliance, including ensuring that the discount rate used reflects the risk profile of the investment and does not include any element of riba. The valuation methodology used and the underlying assumptions must be clearly disclosed in the financial statements.\n\nThis solution aligns with the Shariah principles of fairness (*'adl*), transparency (*wضوh*), and avoiding unjust enrichment (*ghurur*).

          "accounting_rationale": "The proposed accounting clauses address the gaps in FAS 4 regarding diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds using shirkah al-ʿaqd structures. The rationale for each clause is as follows:\n\n*   **FAS4.DM.ACC1:** This clause directly implements the Shariah principle of the periodic transfer of ownership by specifying how the transfer of ownership units should be recognized. It ensures that the reduction in the IFI's investment and the increase in the customer's equity are appropriately recorded, consistent with the diminishing nature of the Musharaka. The reference to AAOIFI AS 13 supports the treatment of Musharaka investments.\n\n*   **FAS4.RV.ACC2:** This clause addresses the revaluation of the underlying real estate assets, which is crucial for fair profit allocation. It aligns with Shariah principles by ensuring equitable distribution of profits and losses based on ownership ratios. The clause also refers to IAS 16 for guidance on the treatment of revaluation gains and losses, ensuring consistency with established accounting practices. The periodic nature of revaluation ensures that financial statements reflect current market conditions.\n\n*   **FAS4.Exit.ACC3:** This clause provides specific guidance on accounting for partner exits, a complex issue in Musharaka arrangements. It ensures that the exiting partner's units are valued fairly based on the underlying asset's fair value. By specifying the recognition of gains or losses upon exit, it enhances the transparency and reliability of the financial statements. The references to AAOIFI AS 13 and IFRS 13 support the fair value measurement and the accounting for changes in ownership interests.\n\n*   **FAS4.ILLIQ.ACC4:** This clause addresses the valuation of illiquid real estate assets, a common challenge in real estate funds. It mandates the use of appropriate valuation techniques and transparent disclosure of the valuation methodology and underlying assumptions. The requirement for a sensitivity analysis enhances the reliability of the fair value measurement by highlighting the potential impact of changes in key assumptions. Shariah advisor review ensures compliance with Shariah principles. The reference to AAOIFI AS 13 and IFRS 13 provides a solid foundation for fair value estimation.\n\n*   **FAS4.DISC.ACC5:** This clause provides comprehensive disclosure requirements for diminishing Musharaka contracts. This enhanced disclosure aligns with the principles of transparency and accountability, crucial in Islamic finance. The disclosure requirements cover all key aspects of the Musharaka arrangement, enabling users of the financial statements to understand the risks and rewards associated with the investment. The references to AAOIFI AS 13 and IFRS 7 support the inclusion of these disclosures.\n\nOverall, these clauses provide a comprehensive framework for accounting for diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds, addressing the identified gaps in FAS 4 and ensuring compliance with Shariah principles and established accounting practices. They are designed to be practically applicable for IFIs and enhance the transparency and reliability of their financial reporting.",

An independent valuer needs to do this at least annually, and any gains or losses are shared based on the partners' ownership at the time.\n*   **Partner Exits:** The update clarifies how to handle situations where a partner wants to leave the *shirkah al-ʿaqd* before the end of the agreement. It covers valuation of their units and how profits or losses are allocated up to their exit date.\n*   **Illiquid Assets:** Because real estate can be hard to value, especially when market data is scarce, we've outlined acceptable valuation methods like discounted cash flow (DCF) and income capitalization. These must be applied consistently and transparently.\n*   **Disclosures:** There are now expanded disclosure requirements.\n\nThese changes are designed to ensure fairness, transparency, and compliance with Shariah principles, drawing on AAOIFI standards and, where relevant, IFRS. They provide a more comprehensive framework for accounting for diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds, addressing gaps in the previous guidance."

Any difference between the fair value of the real estate asset and the total equity contributions shall be accounted for according to AAOIFI standards for initial Musharaka agreements. In diminishing Musharaka contracts within real estate funds structured as shirkah al-ʿaqd, the periodic transfer of ownership units from the Islamic Financial Institution (IFI) to the customer shall be recognized as a reduction in the IFI's investment in the Musharaka and a corresponding increase in the customer's equity. The transfer shall be recorded at the carrying value of the ownership units transferred. Any difference between the carrying value and the payment received from the customer shall be recognized as profit or loss in the period of the transfer, in accordance with the Musharaka agreement. (ref: AAOIFI AS 13, para 3/1, AAOIFI AS 13, paragraph 2.2)\n\n**FAS4.RV.ACC2: Subsequent Revaluation of Real Estate Assets**\nSubsequent to initial recognition, the real estate asset underlying the Diminishing Musharaka shall be revalued periodically by an independent, qualified valuer. The revaluation frequency shall be determined by the Musharaka agreement, but shall occur at least annually, or more frequently if there are indications of significant changes in market conditions. The methodology used for revaluation must be consistent with recognized industry best practices, AAOIFI standards, and be disclosed in the financial statements. Gains or losses resulting from the revaluation shall be allocated to the partners based on their ownership ratios at the time of the revaluation, reflecting the diminishing nature of the IFI's share and the increasing share of the customer. The specific allocation method must be documented and consistently applied. Revaluation gains shall be recognized in a revaluation surplus account within equity, to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the same asset previously recognized as an expense. Revaluation losses shall be recognized as an expense to the extent that they exceed any previous revaluation surplus in respect of the same asset. (ref: AAOIFI AS 13, para 3/5, AAOIFI Governance Standard 2, AAOIFI AS 13, paragraph 3.4; IAS 16.39)\n\n**FAS4.Exit.ACC3: Accounting for Partner Exits**\nIn the event of a partner's exit from the Diminishing Musharaka before the agreement's natural termination, the exiting partner's units shall be valued by an independent valuer. The valuation methodology must be consistent with the initial valuation and any subsequent revaluations of the underlying asset. The exit mechanism (e.g., purchase by remaining partners, sale to a third party, or redemption by the fund) shall be documented in the Musharaka agreement and comply with Shariah principles. Any profit or loss arising from the exit shall be allocated to the exiting partner up to the date of their exit, based on their ownership ratio at that time, and recognized in the period of exit. Upon a partner's exit from the shirkah al-ʿaqd structure before the agreement's natural termination, the value of the exiting partner's units shall be determined based on the fair value of the underlying real estate assets at the time of exit, as determined by a qualified independent valuer. The exit mechanism (sale to the fund, other partners, or a third party) shall be disclosed. Any gain or loss arising from the exit shall be calculated as the difference between the consideration received by the exiting partner and the carrying amount of their investment. This gain or loss shall be recognized immediately in profit or loss. The remaining partners' investment balances shall be adjusted to reflect their revised ownership ratios and the fair value of the underlying assets.

The selection of the appropriate valuation methodology shall be justified and documented, considering the specific characteristics of the real estate asset and the available market data. The assumptions used in the valuation model must be reasonable, supportable, and disclosed. For illiquid real estate assets within the Musharaka, where readily available market prices are unavailable, the fair value shall be estimated using appropriate valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, capitalization rate method, or cost approach, considering the specific characteristics of the property and prevailing market conditions. The valuation methodology and underlying assumptions shall be disclosed transparently in the financial statements. A sensitivity analysis shall be performed to demonstrate the potential impact of changes in key assumptions on the fair value measurement. The valuation process must be reviewed by a Shariah advisor. The valuation model should be applied consistently from period to period unless there is a change in market conditions or the characteristics of the asset that would warrant a change in the model.
