  "change_summary": "Here's a summary of the changes to FAS 32:\n\nWe've updated FAS 32 to provide more clarity on how Islamic Financial Institutions (IFIs) should handle situations where political events create uncertainty. This update focuses on transparency, risk assessment, and staying true to Shariah principles.\n\n**Here's what's new:**\n\n*   **Disclosure:** IFIs now need to disclose potential financial impacts when political uncertainty arises, like when a budget bill fails. This includes impacts on asset values and revenue.\n*   **Risk Assessment:** IFIs must conduct thorough risk assessments, considering different political scenarios, and share these assessments with their Shariah Supervisory Board (SSB) and Board of Directors.\n*   **Conservative Approach:** When making financial projections, IFIs should be conservative, especially when political events could cause negative outcomes.\n*   **Documentation:** The IFI's Shariah Supervisory Board (SSB) and the Board of Directors must document and justify all adjustments made to financial reporting and projections in response to political uncertainties\n*   **Profit Distribution:** IFIs should be cautious about distributing profits during times of political uncertainty, prioritizing reserves to cover potential losses.\n*   **Impairment Testing:** If political uncertainty puts assets at risk, IFIs need to perform impairment tests.\n*   **Shariah Compliance:** All these adjustments must align with Shariah principles, like avoiding excessive uncertainty (\"Gharar\") and exercising precaution (\"Ihtiyat\").\n\n**Why these changes?**\n\nThe recent failure of a budget reconciliation bill highlighted how political events can create financial uncertainty. These updates help IFIs better account for and disclose these risks, ensuring they remain transparent and Shariah-compliant. The changes bring FAS 32 in line with current realities and relevant AAOIFI standards.",

These clauses are directly aligned with the Shariah update provided by SPIA, emphasizing the principles of avoiding gharar (excessive uncertainty) and promoting transparency. They are consistent with existing FAS by providing specific guidance related to a previously unaddressed topic in FAS 32. The clauses also incorporate relevant aspects from AAOIFI standards, such as the principle of Ihtiyat (precaution) and the need for documentation and justification by the SSB and the Board of Directors. The rationale for each clause is as follows:\n\n- FAS32.PoliticalUncertainty.ACC1: This clause provides a general disclosure requirement for significant political events that introduce material uncertainty. It aligns with the Shariah principle of transparency by requiring IFIs to disclose the nature of the event, the range of reasonably possible financial impacts, and the assumptions underlying these estimates. It is consistent with AAOIFI AS 1, Paragraph 42, and FAS 5, which require disclosure of uncertainties that could significantly affect the financial statements. It also conceptually aligns with IFRS IAS 1, paragraph 125, which requires disclosure of key assumptions concerning the future.\n\n- FAS32.PoliticalUncertainty.ACC2: This clause emphasizes the need for a conservative approach when estimating the impact of political events, in line with the Shariah principle of Ihtiyat (precaution). It requires IFIs to consider downside scenarios and their potential impact on the financial position. It is consistent with AAOIFI AS 1, Paragraph 24, and AAOIFI Governance Standard 6, which emphasize the importance of avoiding excessive speculation and promoting prudent financial management. This clause also references FAS 5, emphasizing the consideration of potential losses.\n\n- FAS32.PoliticalUncertainty.ACC3: This clause reinforces the need for documentation and justification by the SSB and the Board of Directors for all adjustments made to financial reporting in response to political uncertainties. This promotes accountability and transparency in the decision-making process. It is consistent with AAOIFI Governance Standard 2 and AAOIFI Governance Standard 6.\n\n- FAS32.PoliticalUncertainty.ACC4: This clause addresses the potential for asset impairment due to political uncertainty. It requires IFIs to perform an impairment test in accordance with the relevant AAOIFI standards, considering the potential impact of the political event on the asset's future cash flows or recoverable amount. It aligns to AAOIFI AS 11 (Impairment), and is consistent with FAS 144 and IFRS IAS 36 in principle.",

    "change_summary": "Here's a summary of the changes to FAS 32:\n\nWe've updated FAS 32 to provide more clarity on how Islamic Financial Institutions (IFIs) should handle situations where political events create uncertainty. This update focuses on transparency, risk assessment, and staying true to Shariah principles.\n\n**Here's what's new:**\n\n*   **Disclosure:** IFIs now need to disclose potential financial impacts when political uncertainty arises, like when a budget bill fails. This includes impacts on asset values and revenue.\n*   **Risk Assessment:** IFIs must conduct thorough risk assessments, considering different political scenarios, and share these assessments with their Shariah Supervisory Board (SSB) and Board of Directors.\n*   **Conservative Approach:** When making financial projections, IFIs should be conservative, especially when political events could cause negative outcomes.\n*   **Documentation:** The IFI's Shariah Supervisory Board (SSB) and the Board of Directors must document and justify all adjustments made to financial reporting and projections in response to political uncertainties\n*   **Profit Distribution:** IFIs should be cautious about distributing profits during times of political uncertainty, prioritizing reserves to cover potential losses.\n*   **Impairment Testing:** If political uncertainty puts assets at risk, IFIs need to perform impairment tests.\n*   **Shariah Compliance:** All these adjustments must align with Shariah principles, like avoiding excessive uncertainty (\"Gharar\") and exercising precaution (\"Ihtiyat\").\n\n**Why these changes?**\n\nThe recent failure of a budget reconciliation bill highlighted how political events can create financial uncertainty. These updates help IFIs better account for and disclose these risks, ensuring they remain transparent and Shariah-compliant. The changes bring FAS 32 in line with current realities and relevant AAOIFI standards."

IFIs must conduct enhanced risk assessments to evaluate the potential impact of various political scenarios on financial projections, asset valuations, and liabilities. This assessment should consider both favorable and unfavorable scenarios, and incorporate sensitivity analyses to gauge the resilience of the IFI's financial position. This disclosure shall adhere to the Shariah principle of avoiding gharar (excessive uncertainty) and promoting transparency in financial dealings. (ref: AAOIFI Governance Standard 6, Shariah Principle of 'Gharar', AAOIFI Governance Standard 2, para 4.2.3 (Risk Management))\n\n**FAS32.SH2:** IFIs shall adopt a conservative approach when estimating the impact of political events on financial projections. Where there is a reasonable possibility of adverse financial outcomes due to political instability or legislative changes, the IFI must consider the downside scenarios and their potential impact on its financial position, ensuring compliance with the Shariah principle of avoiding undue speculation and promoting prudent financial management. Financial reporting should adopt a prudent approach, reflecting the uncertainties introduced by political instability. IFIs must exercise caution in recognizing future gains or assets if their realization is contingent upon specific political outcomes that are uncertain. (ref: AAOIFI Accounting Standard 1, Shariah Principle of 'Ihtiyat' (Precaution), General Shariah Principle: Istishab (Presumption of Continuity) and AAOIFI Accounting Standard 1, para 3.2.1 (Prudence))\n\n**FAS32.SH3:** The IFI's Shariah Supervisory Board (SSB) and the Board of Directors must document and justify all adjustments made to financial reporting and projections in response to political uncertainties. This documentation must clearly articulate how these adjustments align with Shariah principles and Islamic finance standards, promoting accountability and transparency in the IFI’s decision-making processes. IFIs must disclose the key assumptions regarding political factors that underlie their financial projections and the potential financial impact of these factors. This disclosure should include a discussion of the range of possible outcomes and their potential effects on the IFI's financial performance and position. (ref: AAOIFI Governance Standard 2, Resolutions and Recommendations of the Shariah Supervisory Board; General Shariah principle of Accountability, AAOIFI Accounting Standard 1, para 4.1.1 (Disclosure) and General Shariah Principle: Al-Bayan (Clarity))\n\n**FAS32.SH4:** IFIs are required to disclose any political events that could cause a material impact on the fairness and accuracy of its financial statements. The IFI must quantify, to the extent it is reasonably possible, the extent of the potential financial impact of such political events and disclose such quantification to investors and other stakeholders. (ref: IFSB Guiding Principles of Risk Management for Institutions (other than Insurance) offering only Islamic Financial Services)\n\n**FAS32.POL1.ACC1:** In circumstances where significant political events, such as the failure of budget reconciliation bills or legislative gridlock, introduce material uncertainty regarding future tax laws or fiscal policies, IFIs shall disclose the nature of the event, the range of reasonably possible financial impacts (including, but not limited to, potential adjustments to asset valuations, impairment of assets, and alterations in revenue projections), and the assumptions underlying these estimates. This disclosure shall be presented in the notes to the financial statements. This disclosure should include a sensitivity analysis illustrating the impact of potential changes in key assumptions. (ref: AAOIFI AS 1, Paragraph 42; FAS 5; IFRS IAS 1, Paragraph 125; AAOIFI FAS 1, paragraph 45; IFRS 1060.10-1060.13)\n\n**FAS32.POL1.ACC2:** When estimating the impact of political events on financial projections, IFIs shall adopt a conservative approach, in line with the Shariah principle of Ihtiyat (precaution). If there is a reasonable possibility of adverse financial outcomes due to political instability or legislative changes, the IFI must consider downside scenarios and their potential impact on its financial position. Evidence for assumptions must be documented and justifiable. IFIs shall conduct and document a robust risk assessment process that considers various plausible scenarios arising from such political events and their potential impact on the institution's financial position, including liquidity, solvency, and profitability. This assessment shall be reviewed and approved by the Shariah Supervisory Board (SSB) and the board of directors or equivalent governance body of the IFI.

This documentation must clearly articulate how these adjustments align with Shariah principles and Islamic finance standards, and it must be available for audit and regulatory review. In situations of significant political uncertainty, IFIs shall exercise prudence in profit distribution. Any decisions on profit distribution must consider the potential impact of the political event on the IFI's future financial performance and shall be approved by the Shariah Supervisory Board and adequately disclosed to stakeholders. Preference should be given to retaining earnings to bolster reserves and mitigate potential losses, in compliance with Shariah principles. (ref: AAOIFI Governance Standard 2; AAOIFI Governance Standard 6; AAOIFI Shariah Standard 9 on Distribution of Profits; FAS 5)\n\n**FAS32.POL1.ACC4:** If the political uncertainty leads to a significant risk of asset impairment, the IFI shall perform an impairment test in accordance with the relevant AAOIFI standards, considering the potential impact of the political event on the asset's future cash flows or recoverable amount. Impairment losses, if any, shall be recognized immediately in the income statement. IFIs are required to disclose any political events that could cause a material impact on the fairness and accuracy of its financial statements. The IFI must quantify, to the extent it is reasonably possible, the extent of the potential financial impact of such political events, including impairments of assets, changes in liabilities, and effects on future cash flows, and disclose such quantification to investors and other stakeholders. If quantification is not reasonably possible, the IFI shall disclose the reasons why quantification is not possible and provide a qualitative description of the potential impact. Sensitivity analysis, as required by FAS32.SH1, should be conducted for assets and liabilities exposed to political uncertainty, revealing the potential impact of reasonable possible adverse political scenarios on financial performance and the statement of financial position. The results of this analysis should be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
