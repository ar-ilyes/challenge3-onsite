  "change_summary": "FAS 4 has been updated to provide clearer guidance on how to account for diminishing Musharaka real estate funds structured as a *shirkah al-ʿaqd*, specifically regarding partner contributions and exits.\n\nHere's what changed:\n\n*   **Valuation of Non-Cash Contributions:** New Shariah (FAS4.SH1) and accounting (FAS4.DM.ACC1) clauses were added. These state that non-cash contributions (like land) should be valued at fair market value at the time of contribution, determined by an independent expert and approved by the Shariah advisor. This valuation and methodology needs to be well documented and disclosed in the financial statements.\n\n*   **Partner Exits:** New Shariah (FAS4.SH2) and accounting (FAS4.DM.ACC2) clauses were added to address how to handle a partner leaving the fund before maturity. The difference between the exiting partner's investment and what they receive (e.g., sale price) is treated as a profit or loss. This profit or loss is then allocated based on the profit-sharing ratio agreed upon in the original *musharaka* agreement, making sure it's free from *riba* (interest) and excessive *gharar* (uncertainty). Again, how the amount was determined and allocated needs to be disclosed.\n\n**Why were these changes made?**\n\nThe previous version of FAS 4 lacked specific instructions on these issues within the context of diminishing *musharaka shirkah al-ʿaqd* structures. These additions provide more clarity and ensure Shariah compliance and consistency in accounting practices, aligning with existing AAOIFI and IFRS standards. They promote transparency by requiring disclosures related to the valuation methods and profit allocation.",

Specifically, when partners contribute assets other than cash (e.g., land, development rights) to the real estate fund, it's unclear how these non-cash contributions should be initially valued and accounted for under FAS 4 within the framework of diminishing ownership over time. This gap is significant because it affects the accurate recognition of the initial investment and subsequent profit/loss allocation among partners in a Shariah-compliant manner. The absence of specific guidelines creates potential for divergent accounting practices among IFIs."

    "change_summary": "FAS 4 has been updated to provide clearer guidance on how to account for diminishing Musharaka real estate funds structured as a *shirkah al-ʿaqd*, specifically regarding partner contributions and exits.\n\nHere's what changed:\n\n*   **Valuation of Non-Cash Contributions:** New Shariah (FAS4.SH1) and accounting (FAS4.DM.ACC1) clauses were added. These state that non-cash contributions (like land) should be valued at fair market value at the time of contribution, determined by an independent expert and approved by the Shariah advisor. This valuation and methodology needs to be well documented and disclosed in the financial statements.\n\n*   **Partner Exits:** New Shariah (FAS4.SH2) and accounting (FAS4.DM.ACC2) clauses were added to address how to handle a partner leaving the fund before maturity. The difference between the exiting partner's investment and what they receive (e.g., sale price) is treated as a profit or loss. This profit or loss is then allocated based on the profit-sharing ratio agreed upon in the original *musharaka* agreement, making sure it's free from *riba* (interest) and excessive *gharar* (uncertainty). Again, how the amount was determined and allocated needs to be disclosed.\n\n**Why were these changes made?**\n\nThe previous version of FAS 4 lacked specific instructions on these issues within the context of diminishing *musharaka shirkah al-ʿaqd* structures. These additions provide more clarity and ensure Shariah compliance and consistency in accounting practices, aligning with existing AAOIFI and IFRS standards. They promote transparency by requiring disclosures related to the valuation methods and profit allocation.",
