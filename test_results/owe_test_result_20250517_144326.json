  "change_summary": "Based on your request regarding Diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds and its impact on FAS 4, we've updated FAS 4 to provide more clarity on this topic.\n\nHere's a summary of the key changes:\n\n*   **Ownership Transfers:** When the Islamic Financial Institution (IFI) transfers ownership units to the partner, it will be accounted for as a sale. The IFI will reduce its investment, and the partner's equity will increase. Any profit or loss from this sale will be recognized at the time of transfer, ensuring it's free of *riba*. The transfer price needs to be transparent and fair.\n*   **Profit/Loss Allocation:** As the ownership changes, the way profit and loss are shared will be re-evaluated and adjusted accordingly. The new allocation must be agreed upon by all partners and clearly documented. Profit and loss will be distributed fairly based on the current ownership percentages.\n*   **Real Estate Valuation:** The real estate assets will be independently appraised by qualified professionals at least once a year, or more often if the market changes significantly. Any resulting changes in value will be shared among the partners based on their ownership percentages at the time of the valuation change.\n*   **Disclosures:** More detailed information about the Diminishing Musharaka arrangement must be disclosed, including how ownership transfers, profit is allocated, any guarantees involved, details of the independent appraisals, and the impact of any changes in value. This ensures clarity (*wضوح*) for everyone involved. We will also disclose any pre-agreed purchase undertakings and the criteria used for selecting and engaging independent valuers for the real estate assets.\n*   **Partner Exits:** When a partner exits the *shirkah al-ʿaqd*, the value of their share will be determined by a pre-agreed mechanism in the Musharaka agreement, ensuring fairness and preventing any undue advantage. This valuation will consider the fair market value of the real estate at the time of exit and must avoid *maysir*.\n\nThese changes are reflected in the addition of these new clauses: FAS4.SH1, FAS4.SH2, FAS4.SH3, FAS4.SH4, FAS4.SH5, FAS4.DM.ACC1, FAS4.DM.ACC2, FAS4.DM.ACC3, FAS4.DM.ACC4 and FAS4.DM.ACC5.\n\nThese updates aim to provide clear, practical guidance for diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds, adhering to Shariah principles and aligning with AAOIFI standards and IFRS where appropriate. The goal is to ensure transparency, fairness, and consistency in accounting practices for these types of arrangements.",

          "justification": "Diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds involves complex arrangements where partners' shares change over time, affecting profit and loss allocation. FAS 4 provides general principles for Musharaka but lacks detailed rules for the unique aspects of diminishing structures, especially within real estate funds. This includes how to account for the transfer of ownership units, changes in the ratio of ownership, and valuation adjustments due to market fluctuations of the underlying real estate. Without specific guidance, IFIs may adopt inconsistent accounting practices, affecting comparability and transparency. The lack of clarity regarding the treatment of partner contributions and exits in Shirkah al-ʿAqd structures exacerbates this issue, requiring specific guidance on accounting for the changes in ownership shares and the valuation of the remaining equity in the real estate fund."

          "justification": "Real estate valuations are complex and require specialized expertise. FAS 4 provides general guidelines on valuation but does not adequately address the specific nuances within a diminishing Musharaka. As the ownership percentages of the partners change over time, the valuation of the underlying real estate assets and the related investment accounts becomes crucial for accurate financial reporting. The standard needs to address how to incorporate independent appraisals, market comparables, and other valuation techniques within the context of diminishing Musharaka and the changing equity ownerships. Furthermore, guidance is needed on how to account for impairments or revaluations of the real estate assets as they relate to the diminishing structure and profit-sharing ratios. Without this specific guidance, inconsistencies in valuation practices could lead to misrepresentation of the financial performance and position of the real estate fund."

FAS 4's general disclosure requirements may not be sufficient to convey the intricacies of a diminishing Musharaka structure in a real estate fund. Specific disclosure requirements are needed regarding the mechanism for transferring ownership from the IFI to the other partner, the schedule of ownership transfer, the methods for profit allocation based on the changing ownership percentages, and any guarantees or undertakings provided by either party. Providing stakeholders with detailed information about these aspects of the diminishing Musharaka arrangement allows them to better understand the risks and rewards associated with the investment and to make informed decisions. Lack of adequate disclosure could lead to information asymmetry and potential disputes between partners."

Specifically, AAOIFI AS 13 guides profit allocation and revenue recognition, AAOIFI AS 30 provides a framework for fair value measurement, and AAOIFI Governance Standards emphasize transparency and disclosure. IFRS 15 is used conceptually for recognizing profit/loss on transfer of ownership units and IFRS 7 serves as disclosure guidance where no direct AAOIFI equivalent is available. IAS 32 has been cited for equity derecognition. This ensures that the accounting treatment is aligned with both Shariah and internationally recognized accounting standards.\n\nFrom a practical perspective, these rules are designed to be applicable for Islamic Financial Institutions (IFIs) by providing clear and detailed guidance that can be implemented without conflicting with Shariah principles.",

This is consistent with basic accounting principles for equity investments and aligns with AAOIFI AS 12, which discusses the nature of contributions in Musharaka agreements.\n\nClause FAS4.DM.ACC2 provides guidance on accounting for the transfer of ownership units. This aligns with the Shariah principle of 'bay' (sale) as the transfer is considered a sale of equity, with profit or loss recognized in the income statement at the time of transfer. The standard ensures consistency with Shariah by treating the reduction in the IFI's equity as a partial disposal.\n\nClause FAS4.DM.ACC3 addresses the valuation of real estate assets. While AAOIFI standards provide general principles on valuation, it references IAS 40 for guidance on investment property (using fair value model), which ensures the fair presentation of these assets. Revaluation gains and losses are appropriately allocated based on ownership percentages and are handled in accordance with accounting principles ensuring profits are reported when the gains are realised and losses are realised when they are foreseen.\n\nClause FAS4.DM.ACC4 addresses the accounting for partner exits. The revaluation at the time of exit ensures that the exiting partner receives a fair share of the equity based on the current market value. The allocation of profit or loss up to the exit date aligns with the Shariah principle of profit-sharing in Musharaka arrangements. The requirement for Shariah compliance in the exit mechanism ensures the avoidance of riba and gharar, maintaining the integrity of the Islamic finance transaction. \n\nClause FAS4.DM.ACC5 lists the disclosure requirements. These requirements are aligned with AAOIFI AS 1 on disclosure, promoting transparency and accountability. The specific disclosures are designed to provide stakeholders with a clear understanding of the Diminishing Musharaka arrangement, including the transfer mechanism, profit allocation, valuation methods, and related-party transactions. This level of disclosure is essential for ensuring fairness and protecting the rights of all partners and stakeholders, in line with Shariah principles.",

The IFI will reduce its investment, and the partner's equity will increase. Any profit or loss from this sale will be recognized at the time of transfer, ensuring it's free of *riba*. The transfer price needs to be transparent and fair.\n*   **Profit/Loss Allocation:** As the ownership changes, the way profit and loss are shared will be re-evaluated and adjusted accordingly. The new allocation must be agreed upon by all partners and clearly documented. Profit and loss will be distributed fairly based on the current ownership percentages.\n*   **Real Estate Valuation:** The real estate assets will be independently appraised by qualified professionals at least once a year, or more often if the market changes significantly. Any resulting changes in value will be shared among the partners based on their ownership percentages at the time of the valuation change.\n*   **Disclosures:** More detailed information about the Diminishing Musharaka arrangement must be disclosed, including how ownership transfers, profit is allocated, any guarantees involved, details of the independent appraisals, and the impact of any changes in value. This ensures clarity (*wضوح*) for everyone involved. We will also disclose any pre-agreed purchase undertakings and the criteria used for selecting and engaging independent valuers for the real estate assets.\n*   **Partner Exits:** When a partner exits the *shirkah al-ʿaqd*, the value of their share will be determined by a pre-agreed mechanism in the Musharaka agreement, ensuring fairness and preventing any undue advantage. This valuation will consider the fair market value of the real estate at the time of exit and must avoid *maysir*.\n\nThese changes are reflected in the addition of these new clauses: FAS4.SH1, FAS4.SH2, FAS4.SH3, FAS4.SH4, FAS4.SH5, FAS4.DM.ACC1, FAS4.DM.ACC2, FAS4.DM.ACC3, FAS4.DM.ACC4 and FAS4.DM.ACC5.\n\nThese updates aim to provide clear, practical guidance for diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds, adhering to Shariah principles and aligning with AAOIFI standards and IFRS where appropriate.
