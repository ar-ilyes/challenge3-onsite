  "change_summary": "Based on your question about FAS 4 and its application to diminishing Musharaka (specifically shirkah al-ʿaqd) in real estate funds, we've added a new section, **FAS4.DM, Diminishing Musharaka in Real Estate Funds**, to FAS 4.\n\nThis new section provides specific guidance on areas where the original FAS 4 was lacking, namely:\n\n*   **How to handle equity reduction** in a diminishing Musharaka context.\n*   **The accounting treatment for partner contributions and exits**, especially concerning real estate asset valuation.\n\nThe update includes both **Shariah Guidance (FAS4.DM1 - FAS4.DM4)** and **Accounting Treatment (FAS4.DM.ACC1 - FAS4.DM.ACC4)** clauses. Key points covered are:\n\n*   The need for a pre-agreed, transparent, and fair mechanism for reducing a partner's equity share, documented in the Musharaka agreement.\n*   The requirement for an independent valuation of real estate assets upon a partner's exit (or entry) to determine the price of their share, unless all parties agree on a different Shariah-compliant valuation method.\n*   How profits or losses from revaluations should be allocated among partners.\n*   Valuation of partner contributions (cash or in-kind) at fair market value using an independent valuation.\n\nThese changes aim to clarify the accounting for diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds, ensure compliance with Shariah principles, and align with AAOIFI standards (specifically SS 12). We also referenced relevant Fatwas (e.g., 123/2022) and accounting standards (FAS 157) for fair value measurements.",
