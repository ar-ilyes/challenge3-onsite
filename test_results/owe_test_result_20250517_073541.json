The updates focus on areas where the original standard was lacking in detail.\n\nHere's what's new:\n\n*   **Partner Contributions:** Clearer rules for initially recognizing partner contributions at fair value and how subsequent contributions affect ownership.\n\n*   **Partner Exits:** Specific guidance on how to account for a partner leaving the fund, including derecognizing their share at fair value at the time of exit.\n\n*   **Real Estate Valuation:** Requirements for regular valuations by an independent valuer, and how changes in value impact each partner's ownership share.\n\n*   **Impairment Losses:** How impairment losses on the real estate assets should be allocated among partners based on their ownership share.\n\n*   **Ownership Transfer Mechanism:** A new requirement for diminishing Musharaka contracts to clearly define how ownership of the real estate will transfer over time.\n\nThese changes are needed because the original FAS 4 didn't cover the unique aspects of real estate funds using diminishing Musharaka, leading to potential inconsistencies. The new guidance aligns with AAOIFI standards (SS 12) and Shariah principles, providing more clarity and consistency in financial reporting.",
