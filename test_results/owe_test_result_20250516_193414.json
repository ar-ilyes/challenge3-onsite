  "change_summary": "We've updated FAS 4 to provide clearer guidance on how it applies to *Shirkah al-ʿAqd* structures, especially in real estate funds. The main changes address your questions about *diminishing Musharaka*, *partner contributions*, and *partner exits*.\n\nHere's what's new:\n\n*   **General Applicability (FAS4.GA1):** We've made it clear that FAS 4 *does* apply to Shirkah al-ʿAqd, specifically in real estate funds, covering partner contributions, profit/loss, equity changes, and exits.\n*   **Diminishing Musharaka (FAS4.DM1):** Now there's specific guidance on how to account for equity reductions in diminishing Musharaka within Shirkah al-ʿAqd real estate funds. This includes using fair valuation methods for equity transfers and distributing profits/losses accordingly.\n*   **Partner Exits (FAS4.PE1 & FAS4.PE2):** We've detailed the accounting for different exit scenarios like buy-outs, sales to third parties, and fund liquidation. It also emphasizes the need for Shariah-compliant settlements of rights and obligations upon exit, requiring approval from the Shariah Supervisory Board.\n*   **Disclosures (FAS4.DR1):** Shirkah al-ʿAqd real estate funds now have specific disclosure requirements, including details on partner exit mechanisms, valuation methods, profit-sharing, and Shariah compliance.\n\nThese updates clarify how to apply FAS 4 to Shirkah al-ʿAqd structures in real estate funds, ensuring Shariah compliance and providing more transparent accounting. We have updated the Shariah solutions and accounting rationale in line with these changes.",

It also emphasizes the need for Shariah-compliant settlements of rights and obligations upon exit, requiring approval from the Shariah Supervisory Board.\n*   **Disclosures (FAS4.DR1):** Shirkah al-ʿAqd real estate funds now have specific disclosure requirements, including details on partner exit mechanisms, valuation methods, profit-sharing, and Shariah compliance.\n\nThese updates clarify how to apply FAS 4 to Shirkah al-ʿAqd structures in real estate funds, ensuring Shariah compliance and providing more transparent accounting.
