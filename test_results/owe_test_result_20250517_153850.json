  "change_summary": "The FAS 4 standard has been updated to provide more specific guidance on how to account for Diminishing Musharaka (DM) in real estate funds, especially those structured as Shirkah al-ʿAqd. This update addresses partner contributions, the gradual transfer of ownership, and partner exits, which weren't previously detailed enough in FAS 4.\n\nHere's what changed:\n\n*   **Partner Contributions:** When a DM starts, each partner's contribution (cash or property) is now recognized at its fair market value. If the fair market value of a property differs from its book value, the difference is treated as a revaluation gain or loss allocated to the contributing partner.\n\n*   **Transfer of Ownership:** As one partner's ownership decreases and another's increases, this transfer is recognized as an equity purchase by the increasing partner and a corresponding reduction by the diminishing partner, based on the Musharaka agreement.\n\n*   **Revaluation:** The real estate asset is revalued at least annually, and any gains or losses are shared based on ownership percentages.\n\n*   **Partner Exits:** When a partner exits, their share is valued based on the agreed-upon mechanism (ideally fair market value). Any gain or loss from the exit is allocated according to the profit-sharing ratio. The payment should be prompt and Shariah-compliant.\n\n*   **Early Exit Penalties:** Any penalties for early exit must be Shariah-compliant and structured as compensation for actual damages (Ta'widh), not as a fixed, interest-like (Riba) percentage.\n\n*   **Disclosures:** Clear and comprehensive disclosures about the DM arrangement are required in the financial statements, including details on the agreement, valuation methods, profit/loss sharing, ownership percentages, and any partner exits.\n\nThese changes aim to ensure that accounting for DM in real estate funds is transparent, fair, and compliant with Shariah principles, addressing previous uncertainties and inconsistencies.",

FAS 4 provides general guidance on Musharaka, but it doesn't adequately address the unique characteristics of diminishing Musharaka, where one partner's ownership gradually increases while the other's decreases. In the context of real estate funds, this creates uncertainty on how to account for the changing equity positions, profit allocation during the diminishing period, and the valuation of the underlying real estate asset as ownership transfers. The absence of specific guidance could lead to inconsistent accounting practices among IFIs. Specifically, the standard does not address the implications of Shirkah al-ʿAqd structures, which require clarity regarding the treatment of partner contributions and exits under a diminishing structure within a real estate fund setting."

FAS 4 lacks specific provisions on how to account for the sale or transfer of a partner's stake during the diminishing period.

The standard needs to address the appropriate accounting treatment for gains or losses arising from such exits, the valuation of the exiting partner's share, and the impact on the remaining partners' equity. Furthermore, it does not provide guidance on the redemption process or potential penalties or adjustments associated with early exit, leading to potential ambiguity and non-uniform reporting among Islamic financial institutions."

Specifically, these clauses provide guidance on: the initial recognition and valuation of partner contributions (both cash and in-kind) at fair market value (FAS4.DM.ACC1); the accounting for the gradual transfer of ownership (FAS4.DM.ACC2); the periodic revaluation of real estate assets (FAS4.DM.ACC3); the accounting for partner exits, including the determination of the exit value and the allocation of any resulting gains or losses (FAS4.DM.ACC4); and the required disclosures to ensure transparency and understandability of the Diminishing Musharaka arrangement (FAS4.DM.ACC5). The accounting treatment aligns with Shariah principles by ensuring fair valuation, equitable allocation of profits and losses, and adherence to the terms of the Musharaka agreement. The clauses are consistent with existing AAOIFI standards, particularly AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12 (Musharaka) and AAOIFI AS 3 (Basic Concepts), by adhering to the principles of fair value measurement, profit and loss sharing, and adherence to contractual terms. The accounting logic also draws on relevant aspects of IFRS (e.g., IAS 40 for investment property and IAS 1 for disclosures) to provide a comprehensive and practical framework for IFIs. This updated approach helps ensure a proper accounting treatment that is Shariah compliant and avoids practices such as Riba and Gharar. The clauses address practical considerations for IFIs by requiring independent valuations where necessary and emphasizing the importance of clear and comprehensive disclosures. The rationale for requiring fair value at initial recognition (FAS4.DM.ACC1) ensures that the economic substance of the transaction is reflected in the financial statements. The periodic revaluation (FAS4.DM.ACC3) aligns with the economic reality of real estate investments and provides stakeholders with relevant information about the performance of the fund. The detailed guidance on partner exits (FAS4.DM.ACC4) addresses a complex area of Diminishing Musharaka arrangements and ensures that the exit is accounted for in a fair and transparent manner. The disclosure requirements (FAS4.DM.ACC5) are essential for providing stakeholders with a clear understanding of the Diminishing Musharaka arrangement and its potential impact on the financial statements.",

It addresses the need for clarity in accounting for the gradual transfer of ownership. Consistent with AAOIFI AS 12, which outlines the accounting for Islamic investment funds, and FAS 4, which guides investment accounting. Practically, IFIs need clear guidelines to ensure accurate reflection of ownership changes in their financial statements.\n*   **FAS4.DM.ACC2**: This clause ensures that profit allocation reflects the changing equity ratios, adhering to Shariah principles that prohibit riba and gharar. This ensures the profit distribution is transparent and easily auditable. This is grounded in AAOIFI AS 13 on Mudarabah which necessitates clear agreements. IFIs must have a transparent and Shariah-compliant profit-sharing mechanism.\n*   **FAS4.DM.ACC3**: This clause addresses partner exits, ensuring that the valuation of the exiting partner's share is fair and in accordance with the Shirkah al-ʿAqd agreement. This implements AAOIFI AS 3 concerning Murabaha by fulfilling contractual obligations and promoting fair valuation. IFIs need guidelines to ensure exits are handled fairly and transparently.\n*   **FAS4.DM.ACC4**: This clause focuses on penalties for early exits, ensuring they comply with Shariah principles and do not result in unjust enrichment. The clause reinforces the importance of transparency and adherence to Shariah principles. Consistent with AAOIFI Shariah Standard 2 which focuses on fairness and avoiding exploitation (la darar wa la dirar). IFIs need to be cautious in structuring exit penalties to avoid Shariah non-compliance.\n*   **FAS4.DM.ACC5**: This clause allows for the revaluation of the underlying real estate asset held under a diminishing Musharaka arrangement, promoting a fair and accurate reflection of its market value. It is also consistent with the requirement to apply a Shariah-compliant valuation method approved by the Shariah board. Draws conceptual alignment from IAS 16 that allows for the revaluation model in accounting for property, plant and equipment. This approach ensures the financial statements provide a more accurate picture of the fund's financial position, especially in fluctuating real estate markets. \n\nThe proposed clauses are consistent with existing FAS principles while incorporating Shariah requirements and best practices.

These clauses are designed to ensure that the accounting treatment reflects the economic substance of the transactions while adhering to Shariah principles.\n\nFAS4.DM.ACC1: This clause directly implements FAS4.SH1 by specifying how the transfer of ownership is recognized – as a purchase and sale of equity. It addresses the accounting gap by providing a clear mechanism for adjusting the equity accounts and profit/loss sharing ratio. The clause's reference to AAOIFI AS 13 provides a basis for the equity accounting treatment, while the reference to FAS 4 provides an analogy. The consideration of adjustments to the profit/loss sharing ratio helps in accurately reflecting the changing equity stakes and ensures fairness.\n\nFAS4.DM.ACC2: This clause is aligned with FAS4.SH2, detailing the valuation requirements for the underlying real estate asset. It closes the gap by providing a framework for periodic valuation and the allocation of gains/losses. The reference to AAOIFI AS 13 provides support for revaluation practices, while IFRS 13 provides conceptual alignment for fair value measurement. Requiring disclosure of the valuation method enhances transparency.\n\nFAS4.DM.ACC3: This clause implements FAS4.SH3, specifying how partner exits are to be accounted for. It addresses the gap by detailing the derecognition of equity and the recognition of profit/loss on disposal. The reference to AAOIFI AS 13 guides the derecognition process, and the reference to FAS 4 provides an analogy for the accounting of investment disposals.\n\nFAS4.DM.ACC4: This clause is based on FAS4.SH4, covering the treatment of penalties or adjustments for early exit. It emphasizes Shariah compliance and ensures that penalties are accounted for appropriately. The reference to AAOIFI Shariah Standard 2 on Murabaha supports the principle of 'Ta'widh' and the prohibition of Riba.\n\nFAS4.DM.ACC5: This clause is aligned with FAS4.SH5, mandating detailed disclosures related to Diminishing Musharaka transactions. It addresses the gap by ensuring transparency and providing comprehensive information to users of financial statements. The reference to AAOIFI AS 13 provides guidance on disclosures, and the reference to FAS 4 provides an analogy for investment disclosures.\n\nThe overall approach is consistent with existing FAS principles, AAOIFI standards, and relevant IFRS guidance, while specifically addressing the nuances of Diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds. These clauses provide a practical framework for IFIs to account for these transactions in a Shariah-compliant manner.",

    "change_summary": "The FAS 4 standard has been updated to provide more specific guidance on how to account for Diminishing Musharaka (DM) in real estate funds, especially those structured as Shirkah al-ʿAqd. This update addresses partner contributions, the gradual transfer of ownership, and partner exits, which weren't previously detailed enough in FAS 4.\n\nHere's what changed:\n\n*   **Partner Contributions:** When a DM starts, each partner's contribution (cash or property) is now recognized at its fair market value. If the fair market value of a property differs from its book value, the difference is treated as a revaluation gain or loss allocated to the contributing partner.\n\n*   **Transfer of Ownership:** As one partner's ownership decreases and another's increases, this transfer is recognized as an equity purchase by the increasing partner and a corresponding reduction by the diminishing partner, based on the Musharaka agreement.\n\n*   **Revaluation:** The real estate asset is revalued at least annually, and any gains or losses are shared based on ownership percentages.\n\n*   **Partner Exits:** When a partner exits, their share is valued based on the agreed-upon mechanism (ideally fair market value). Any gain or loss from the exit is allocated according to the profit-sharing ratio. The payment should be prompt and Shariah-compliant.\n\n*   **Early Exit Penalties:** Any penalties for early exit must be Shariah-compliant and structured as compensation for actual damages (Ta'widh), not as a fixed, interest-like (Riba) percentage.\n\n*   **Disclosures:** Clear and comprehensive disclosures about the DM arrangement are required in the financial statements, including details on the agreement, valuation methods, profit/loss sharing, ownership percentages, and any partner exits.\n\nThese changes aim to ensure that accounting for DM in real estate funds is transparent, fair, and compliant with Shariah principles, addressing previous uncertainties and inconsistencies."

The accounting treatment for the sale or transfer of a partner's stake shall reflect the actual transaction price, provided it aligns with fair market value, or an independent valuation if the transaction is between related parties. Any gains or losses arising from the exit shall be allocated in accordance with the agreed-upon profit-sharing ratio, ensuring that the distribution adheres to Shariah principles.

Any gain or loss arising from the exit, calculated as the difference between the exit value and the exiting partner's carrying amount, shall be allocated to the exiting partner's capital account in accordance with the agreed-upon profit-sharing ratio and recognized in the period of the exit. The redemption of the partner’s share shall be executed promptly in accordance with Shariah principles.

The exiting partner shall receive consideration as per the Musharaka agreement (Shirkah al-ʿAqd), which may be in the form of cash or in-kind assets acceptable under Shariah. Any difference between the carrying amount of the derecognized equity and the consideration received by the exiting partner shall be recognized as a profit or loss on disposal within investment income in the period of exit.

If deemed compliant, these penalties or adjustments shall be recognized as either income or expense, depending on whether the institution is receiving or paying the penalty. The nature and amount of these penalties or adjustments shall be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements, along with a confirmation of their Shariah compliance.

        "justification": "Addition of FAS4.SH1: This clause outlines the Shariah perspective on the gradual transfer of ownership in a diminishing Musharaka, stating it should be accounted for based on the diminishing partner's relinquishment of rights and the increase in the other partner's rights, reflecting adjustments to equity accounts as per the Musharaka agreement. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12 (Musharaka) paragraphs 4.3 and 4.4).\n\nAddition of FAS4.SH2: This clause provides Shariah guidance on the valuation of partner contributions in diminishing Musharaka, requiring fair market value at inception and appropriate disclosure of any differences between book and fair values. Revaluations must be periodic, with gains/losses allocated based on ownership percentages. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12 (Musharaka) paragraph 4.2; principles of 'mal mutaqawwim' (valuable asset) and 'riba-free valuation').\n\nAddition of FAS4.SH3: This clause addresses partner exits in diminishing Musharaka, mandating that they adhere to the Musharaka agreement and reflect fair market value. Gains/losses must be allocated according to the profit-sharing ratio, and early exits are subject to Shariah-compliant penalties/adjustments.

The redemption must be prompt and Shariah-compliant. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12 (Musharaka) section on dissolution of Musharaka, principles of 'adam al-gharar' (avoidance of uncertainty)).\n\nAddition of FAS4.SH5: This clause emphasizes the need for proper documentation and disclosure of all transactions related to ownership transfer and partner exits, adhering to Shariah principles of transparency (Wضوh). (ref: AAOIFI Governance Standard for Islamic Financial Institutions, Principle of 'Transparency' (Wضوh)).\n\nAddition of FAS4.DM.ACC1: This clause defines the accounting treatment for initial contributions in a Diminishing Musharaka, requiring recognition at fair market value. Any difference between fair and book value is treated as a revaluation gain/loss allocated to the contributing partner, subject to SSB approval. It also outlines the accounting for subsequent transfers of ownership, where the price difference is recognized as an adjustment to the profit/loss sharing ratio.

It states the real estate asset should be valued at least annually, and gains or losses arising from the revaluation should be allocated based on ownership percentages. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12 (Musharaka) paras 4.3 and 4.4; AAOIFI AS 3 para 4.1; AAOIFI AS 13, para 34; IFRS 13 (Conceptual Alignment)).\n\nAddition of FAS4.DM.ACC3: This clause outlines the accounting for partner exits in Diminishing Musharaka, mandating valuation based on the agreed-upon mechanism, preferably fair market value. Gains or losses are allocated to the exiting partner's capital account. (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12 (Musharaka) para 4.6, AAOIFI AS 11 (Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets) if penalties lead to a liability; AAOIFI AS 13, para 45; FAS 4 (analogy for disposal of investments)).\n\nAddition of FAS4.DM.ACC4: This clause states that any penalties or adjustments specified in the Musharaka agreement for early exit must be assessed for Shariah compliance and recognized as either income or expense. Penalties should compensate for actual damages incurred due to the early exit (Ta'widh) and not as a fixed percentage unrelated to actual harm (Riba). (ref: AAOIFI Shariah Standard 2 (Murabaha), Principle of 'Ta'widh' (Compensation for Damages); AAOIFI Shariah Standard 2 (Murabaha), Principle of 'Ta'widh' (Compensation for Damages)).\n\nAddition of FAS4.DM.ACC5: This clause mandates that the Musharaka agreement clearly define the process for determining fair market value and the allocation of profits, losses, and expenses. It requires comprehensive disclosures regarding the Diminishing Musharaka arrangement in the financial statements. (ref: AAOIFI AS 1 (Presentation and Disclosure in Financial Statements of Islamic Financial Institutions), IAS 1 (Presentation of Financial Statements) - principles of disclosure; AAOIFI AS 13, para 50-54; FAS 4, para 20 (analogy for investment disclosures)).",
