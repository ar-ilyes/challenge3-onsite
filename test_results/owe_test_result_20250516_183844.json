This includes how to handle the gradual transfer of ownership, asset valuation, profit distribution, and partner exits.\n\nSpecifically, we've added new sections (FAS4.DM1-4 and FAS4.DM.ACC1-4) that detail:\n\n*   **How to clearly define the gradual transfer of ownership** from the fund to the partner in the Musharaka agreement, including schedules and calculation methods.\n*   **How to value real estate assets** periodically using Shariah-compliant methods, and how to reflect these changes in the partners' equity accounts.\n*   **How to adjust profit distribution** to reflect the changing ownership percentages of the partners as the Musharaka diminishes.\n*   **How to handle final settlements** when a partner exits the Musharaka, including the recognition and distribution of gains or losses.\n\nThese changes are designed to ensure fairness, transparency, and compliance with Shariah principles, particularly AAOIFI SS 12. The updates address previous gaps in FAS 4 concerning these specific aspects of diminishing Musharaka.",
