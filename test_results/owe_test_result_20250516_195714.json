  "change_summary": "Here's a summary of the changes made to FAS 4, addressing your concerns about diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds using Shirkah al-ʿAqd structures:\n\nWe've added new clauses to both the Shariah and Accounting sections of FAS 4 to provide specific guidance on this area.\n\n**What's Changed:**\n\n*   **Shariah Section:** Four new clauses (FAS4.DM1 - FAS4.DM4) have been added to cover Shirkah al-ʿAqd structures in diminishing Musharaka real estate funds. These clauses clarify how partner contributions should be defined, how profit and loss should be allocated, and what mechanisms should be used for partner exits and termination of the Musharaka.\n*   **Accounting Section:** Four corresponding accounting clauses (FAS4.DM.ACC1 - FAS4.DM.ACC4) were added. They cover the accounting treatment for the same areas: initial contributions, profit/loss distribution, partner exits (including the gradual transfer of ownership), and the final termination of the Musharaka. These clauses explain how to record these transactions in the financial statements, including the recognition of gains or losses on the transfer of ownership.\n*   **References:** We've also updated the references to include AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12 (SS 12) and FAS XXX (a placeholder for a fair value measurement standard, to be specified).\n\n**Why These Changes Were Made:**\n\nYou highlighted that FAS 4 didn't adequately cover Shirkah al-ʿAqd structures, especially concerning diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds, and specifically regarding partner contributions and exits. These additions aim to fill that gap, providing clear Shariah and accounting guidance for these types of transactions. The changes ensure alignment with AAOIFI standards and general Shariah principles while also providing practical guidance for Islamic Financial Institutions. The inclusion of references to fair value measurement (FAS XXX) aligns the standard with broader accounting principles.",

    "change_summary": "Here's a summary of the changes made to FAS 4, addressing your concerns about diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds using Shirkah al-ʿAqd structures:\n\nWe've added new clauses to both the Shariah and Accounting sections of FAS 4 to provide specific guidance on this area.\n\n**What's Changed:**\n\n*   **Shariah Section:** Four new clauses (FAS4.DM1 - FAS4.DM4) have been added to cover Shirkah al-ʿAqd structures in diminishing Musharaka real estate funds. These clauses clarify how partner contributions should be defined, how profit and loss should be allocated, and what mechanisms should be used for partner exits and termination of the Musharaka.\n*   **Accounting Section:** Four corresponding accounting clauses (FAS4.DM.ACC1 - FAS4.DM.ACC4) were added. They cover the accounting treatment for the same areas: initial contributions, profit/loss distribution, partner exits (including the gradual transfer of ownership), and the final termination of the Musharaka. These clauses explain how to record these transactions in the financial statements, including the recognition of gains or losses on the transfer of ownership.\n*   **References:** We've also updated the references to include AAOIFI Shariah Standard 12 (SS 12) and FAS XXX (a placeholder for a fair value measurement standard, to be specified).\n\n**Why These Changes Were Made:**\n\nYou highlighted that FAS 4 didn't adequately cover Shirkah al-ʿAqd structures, especially concerning diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds, and specifically regarding partner contributions and exits. These additions aim to fill that gap, providing clear Shariah and accounting guidance for these types of transactions. The changes ensure alignment with AAOIFI standards and general Shariah principles while also providing practical guidance for Islamic Financial Institutions. The inclusion of references to fair value measurement (FAS XXX) aligns the standard with broader accounting principles.",

Profits are distributed based on an agreed-upon ratio, while losses are borne in proportion to capital contribution unless otherwise justified and agreed upon in a Shariah-compliant manner.\n\n**FAS4.DM3: Partner Exits and Gradual Transfer of Ownership**\nThe contract should outline the process for a partner to exit the Shirkah al-ʿAqd and the method for the gradual transfer of ownership in a diminishing Musharaka. Transfers should ideally be at fair value at the time of transfer.\n\n**FAS4.DM4: Termination of the Musharaka**\nThe conditions and procedures for the termination of the Shirkah al-ʿAqd, including the settlement of accounts and distribution of assets, should be clearly defined in the contract.\n\n## Accounting Treatment for Diminishing Musharaka in Shirkah al-ʿAqd Real Estate Funds\n\n**FAS4.DM.ACC1: Initial Contributions**\nInitial contributions, whether monetary or non-monetary, are recognized upon commencement of the Shirkah al-ʿAqd. Non-monetary asset contributions should be valued by independent and qualified valuers, with the valuation agreed upon by all partners. Monetary contributions are measured at their nominal value.\n\n**FAS4.DM.ACC2: Profit/Loss Distribution**\nProfits and losses are recognized based on the agreed-upon profit and loss sharing ratio, as defined in the Shirkah al-ʿAqd agreement. This mechanism should be consistently applied and disclosed in the financial statements.\n\n**FAS4.DM.ACC3: Partner Exits and Gradual Transfer of Ownership**\nThe transfer of a share to the partner is treated as a sale, typically at fair value. The difference between the carrying amount (of the portion of capital sold) and the fair value (sale price received) is recognized as profit or loss in the Islamic bank's income statement.\n\n**FAS4.DM.ACC4: Termination of Musharaka**\nAny gain or loss arising on termination is recognized in the income statement. The gain or loss is calculated as the difference between the proceeds received and the carrying amount of the share at the time of termination.\n\n**References:**\nAAOIFI Shariah Standard 12 (SS 12) and FAS XXX (Fair Value Measurement Standard)",
