The key changes focus on:\n\n*   **Partner Contributions:** We've added specific requirements for defining and valuing partner contributions, especially when using assets instead of cash.\n*   **Profit & Loss Allocation:** The updated standard now explains how to adjust profit and loss distribution as ownership changes during the diminishing phase.\n*   **Partner Exits & Valuation:** We've included guidance on using Shariah-compliant valuation methods when a partner exits the fund, ensuring fair market value is considered.\n*   **Permissible Investments:** Clear rules have been added to ensure that real estate funds only invest in activities and assets that comply with Shariah principles.\n\nThese changes aim to address the specific challenges of applying diminishing Musharaka (particularly *shirkah al-ʿaqd* structures) within real estate funds, referencing AAOIFI standards and principles of fairness and transparency. The updates affect the general application of FAS 4, as well as sections on profit/loss allocation and partner exits/valuation within a diminishing Musharaka context.",
