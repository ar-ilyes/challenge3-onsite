  "document": "\n## Key Changes from Previous FAS Version\n\n## Key Changes\n\nWe've updated FAS 4 to provide more specific guidance on how it applies to diminishing Musharaka structures, especially in real estate funds. Here's a breakdown of the key changes:\n\n*   **Diminishing Musharaka in Real Estate Funds:** We've added specific considerations for these types of investments, recognizing they have unique characteristics not fully addressed in the original standard.\n*   **Partner Contributions & Withdrawals:** The accounting treatment for partner contributions (how equity is increased) and withdrawals (how equity is reduced) in diminishing Musharaka real estate funds has been clarified.\n*   **Real Estate Valuation:** We've introduced guidance on how to value real estate assets within these funds. A key requirement is using independent, Shariah-compliant valuation experts to determine fair value, at least annually.\n*   **Enhanced Disclosures:** We've increased disclosure requirements for real estate funds using diminishing Musharaka. You'll now need to provide more details on the Musharaka agreement itself, the valuation methods used, specific risks (like liquidity and market risks), any related party transactions, and information about how fair rental rates are determined.\n\nThese changes aim to make FAS 4 clearer and more applicable to the specific context of diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds, addressing concerns about partner contributions, exits, and valuation, while also increasing transparency for investors.\n\n{\n  \"pages\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Title & Effective Date\",\n      \"content\": {\n        \"standard_number\": \"FAS 4 (Revised 2024)\",\n        \"title\": \"Accounting for Musharaka Contracts with Specific Considerations for Diminishing Musharaka in Real Estate Funds\",\n        \"example_title\": \"Accounting for Innovative Digital Assets\",\n        \"effective_date\": \"01 January 2025 (Gregorian) / 19 Jumada II 1446 (Hijri)\",\n        \"issued_by\": \"AI-Driven Standard Enhancement System (Conceptual)\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Objective, Scope & Key Principles\",\n      \"content\": {\n        \"objective\": [\n          \"To provide specific accounting guidance for diminishing Musharaka contracts, particularly within the context of real estate funds.\",\n          \"To clarify the treatment of partner contributions, equity reduction, asset valuation, and related disclosures.\"\n        ],\n        \"scope\": {\n          \"applicable_transactions_entities\": \"This standard applies to all Islamic financial institutions that engage in diminishing Musharaka contracts, specifically within real estate funds (shirkah al-\\u02bfaqd).\",\n          \"exclusions\": \"This standard does not cover general partnership arrangements or Musharaka contracts outside of real estate funds, unless explicitly stated within the subsequent clauses.\"\n        },\n        \"key_shariah_principles\": [\n          \"Shirkah al-\\u02bfAqd (Partnership Contract)\",\n          \"Equity Participation\",\n          \"Fair Valuation\",\n          \"Transparency\"\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Definitions\",\n      \"content\": {\n        \"definitions\": [\n          {\n            \"term\": \"Diminishing Musharaka\",\n            \"definition\": \"A Musharaka contract where one partner gradually transfers their equity share to the other partner over a defined period.\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"term\": \"Shirkah al-\\u02bfAqd\",\n            \"definition\": \"A contractual partnership arrangement where partners contribute capital to a joint venture.\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"term\": \"Real Estate Fund\",\n            \"definition\": \"An investment fund that invests primarily in real estate assets.\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"term\": \"Fair Value\",\n            \"definition\": \"The price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Recognition and Initial Measurement\",\n      \"content\": {\n        \"recognition\": {\n          \"general_criteria\": \"An item should be recognized in the financial statements when it meets the definition of an asset, liability, or equity and it is probable that any future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to or from the entity, and the item has a cost or value that can be measured reliably.\",\n          \"specific_points\": \"Partner contributions in diminishing Musharaka within real estate funds shall be recognized as an increase in the fund's equity upon receipt.

A key requirement is using independent, Shariah-compliant valuation experts to determine fair value, at least annually.\n*   **Enhanced Disclosures:** We've increased disclosure requirements for real estate funds using diminishing Musharaka. You'll now need to provide more details on the Musharaka agreement itself, the valuation methods used, specific risks (like liquidity and market risks), any related party transactions, and information about how fair rental rates are determined.\n\nThese changes aim to make FAS 4 clearer and more applicable to the specific context of diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds, addressing concerns about partner contributions, exits, and valuation, while also increasing transparency for investors.",
