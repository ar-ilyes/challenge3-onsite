This includes guidance on valuing assets during these events.\n*   **Musharaka Asset Treatment:** Clarification is provided on how to account for Musharaka assets as a partner's share changes.\n*   **Disclosure Requirements:** The new accounting clauses include disclosure requirements to ensure greater transparency.\n\nThese changes aim to address the lack of specific guidance in the original FAS 4 regarding these complex scenarios, promoting consistent interpretation and application, particularly concerning partner contributions and exits. The updates are aligned with Shariah principles and enhance transparency.",
