  "change_summary": "FAS 4 has been updated to provide specific guidance on how to account for Diminishing Musharaka investments in real estate funds structured as Shirkah al-ʿAqd.\n\nHere's what's changed:\n\n*   **Initial Recognition:** The investment is now recognized at the fair value of each partner's contribution at the start of the agreement, or at cost.\n*   **Subsequent Measurement:** The investment's value is adjusted regularly to reflect changes in ownership as the Diminishing Musharaka progresses. The underlying real estate is revalued at least annually by an independent valuer, and any gains or losses are shared based on the ownership percentages at the time.\n*   **Disclosures:** More detailed disclosures are required, including the terms of the Diminishing Musharaka agreement, profit/loss sharing ratios, the diminishing ownership schedule, any restrictions, and the valuation methods used.\n*   **Disposal:** When a partner exits the investment early, their share is valued at fair value at the time of disposal, using a Shariah-compliant valuation method. Any gain or loss is recognized.\n\nThese changes aim to provide clarity and consistency in accounting practices for these types of investments, ensuring they align with Shariah principles and relevant AAOIFI standards. The updates address how to handle the changing ownership percentages, the impact of market fluctuations, and the accounting for partner exits.",

          "justification": "While FAS 4 addresses investment in real estate, it does not provide specific guidelines for diminishing Musharaka, a common Shariah-compliant financing structure. This is problematic because the unique nature of diminishing Musharaka, where one partner's share gradually decreases while the other's increases, requires specific accounting treatment to accurately reflect the changing ownership and profit/loss sharing ratios over time. The absence of specific rules creates ambiguity in how IFIs should recognize, measure, and report such investments, especially concerning the equity contributions and profit distribution. This is further complicated by Shirkah al-ʿAqd structures."

          "justification": "FAS 4 provides general guidance on measuring real estate investments. However, it does not explicitly address the valuation complexities introduced by diminishing Musharaka. In a diminishing Musharaka, the ownership share and associated rights fluctuate over time. Market fluctuations impacting the real estate value should be allocated proportionally based on the agreed diminishing Musharaka schedule. FAS 4 lacks specific guidance on how to account for these adjustments in a Shariah-compliant manner, potentially leading to inconsistent or inaccurate financial reporting. Specifics are needed to delineate how the changing ownership affects the application of cost, fair value, or any other applicable valuation model."

To ensure transparency and comparability, IFIs should disclose information about the diminishing Musharaka contract, including the initial capital contributions, profit/loss sharing ratios, schedule of diminishing ownership, and any restrictions on the fund's operations.

The clauses ensure Shariah compliance by adhering to the principles of fair valuation, profit and loss sharing as per the contract, and transparency. FAS 4, while not explicitly addressing Diminishing Musharaka, provides a general framework for investment accounting. These updated clauses supplement FAS 4 by providing specific guidance for Diminishing Musharaka, drawing upon AAOIFI Shariah and Accounting Standards, particularly AAOIFI AS 12 on Musharaka and AAOIFI Governance Standard 4 on Disclosure. IFRS is used as a conceptual reference where it does not conflict with Shariah principles, for example, IFRS 13 on fair value measurement and IAS 40 on Investment Property, guiding the valuation process.

The clauses promote consistency and comparability in the accounting practices of IFIs dealing with these investments. Specifically, FAS4.DM.ACC1 aligns with AAOIFI AS 12 by emphasizing the initial recognition at fair value, reflecting each partner's contribution. FAS4.DM.ACC2 builds on AAOIFI AS 12 by requiring periodic revaluation and allocation of gains/losses based on ownership percentages. FAS4.DM.ACC3 addresses the disclosure gaps by providing a comprehensive list of required disclosures, consistent with AAOIFI Governance Standard 4. FAS4.DM.ACC4 tackles the accounting for early exits, drawing on the principles of 'tasaawuq' for fair value determination and aligning with AAOIFI AS 12 on the treatment of gains/losses.",
