This update addresses your concerns about partner contributions and exits.\n\nHere's what's new:\n\n*   **Partner Contributions:** Clearer rules on how to value and record contributions (cash or assets) made by partners at the start.\n*   **Profit & Loss Distribution:** Updated guidelines on how to distribute profits and losses as partners' ownership changes over time. The diminishing partner's share of profit shall reduce proportionately with their diminishing equity stake\n*   **Partner Exits:** Specific instructions on valuing a departing partner's stake and settling their accounts in a Shariah-compliant way.\n*   **Ownership Transfer:** Guidance on how to account for the transfer of ownership units when a partner leaves, including disclosures in the financial statements.\n\nWhy these changes?\n\nThe original FAS 4 lacked detailed guidance for these specific situations in diminishing Musharaka real estate funds. These updates bring FAS 4 in line with Shariah principles (fair valuation, equitable profit-sharing) and enhance transparency for Islamic Financial Institutions. We've referenced AAOIFI standards (SS 12) and relevant Fatwas, as well as other FAS standards (FAS XXX, FAS XX, FAS YY - specific numbers to be added based on applicability) to provide a comprehensive framework.",
