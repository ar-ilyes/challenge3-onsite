  "change_summary": "The changes to FAS 4 provide more specific guidance on how to account for diminishing Musharaka when used in real estate funds. We've added new clauses to cover areas that weren't previously detailed enough, including:\n\n*   **Shariah Compliance (FAS4.DM1-3):** These clauses ensure the diminishing Musharaka contract adheres to Shariah principles, particularly regarding the gradual transfer of ownership, the valuation of real estate assets, and exit strategies for partners.\n*   **Accounting for Ownership Transfer (FAS4.DM.ACC1):** This clarifies how to record the gradual transfer of ownership as equity transactions.\n*   **Accounting for Partner Contributions (FAS4.DM.ACC2):** This gives specific guidance on how to account for partner contributions, whether they are in cash or in the form of assets like land. It also addresses how to handle changes in the value of these assets over time, adhering to the principle of *ghunm bil-ghurm* (benefit is tied to liability).\n*   **Accounting for Exit Strategies (FAS4.DM.ACC3):** This outlines the accounting treatment for various exit scenarios, such as selling shares or selling the property.\n*   **Valuation of Real Estate Assets (FAS4.DM.ACC4):** This emphasizes the importance of independent, periodic valuations of the real estate assets, with changes in value reflected in partner capital accounts.\n\nThese updates address gaps in FAS 4 related to partner contributions, exit strategies, and the unique aspects of real estate funds. We've also updated references to include relevant AAOIFI standards and principles. The goal is to ensure more consistent and Shariah-compliant accounting practices for diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds.",
