  "document": "\n## Key Changes from Previous FAS Version\n\n## Key Changes\n\nHere's a summary of the changes to FAS 4 related to Diminishing Musharaka, especially as it applies to real estate funds:\n\nWe've added new clauses to both the Shariah and Accounting sections of FAS 4 to provide more specific guidance on Diminishing Musharaka. These changes focus on three key areas:\n\n1.  **Valuation of Real Estate Assets:** The updated standard now requires an independent, qualified appraisal of the real estate at least annually, with adjustments reflected in partner equity based on ownership percentages. The valuation method must align with Shariah principles.\n2.  **Partner Exits:** The changes clarify how to account for gains or losses when a partner exits the Musharaka. Any difference between the exit value and the book value of the partner's share should be recognized immediately as a gain or loss and disclosed in the financial statements.\n3.  **Disclosure Requirements:** We've enhanced the disclosure requirements to ensure greater transparency. Entities using Diminishing Musharaka must now disclose the equity reduction schedule, profit distribution formula, procedures for partner exits (including penalties/restrictions), and the valuation methodology used for the assets.\n\nThese updates aim to address previous gaps in FAS 4, promoting consistent accounting practices and improved transparency in Diminishing Musharaka arrangements. The changes are aligned with Shariah principles and international best practices, referencing AAOIFI Standard 12 for further guidance.\n\n{\n  \"pages\": [\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Title & Effective Date\",\n      \"content\": {\n        \"standard_number\": \"FAS 4 (Revised 2024)\",\n        \"title\": \"Accounting for Diminishing Musharaka in Real Estate Funds\",\n        \"example_title\": \"Accounting for Innovative Digital Assets\",\n        \"effective_date\": \"01 January 2025 (Gregorian) / 21 Jumada II 1446 (Hijri)\",\n        \"issued_by\": \"AI-Driven Standard Enhancement System (Conceptual)\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Objective, Scope & Key Principles\",\n      \"content\": {\n        \"objective\": [\n          \"To provide specific guidance on the accounting treatment of Diminishing Musharaka contracts, particularly those related to real estate funds, addressing valuation, partner exits, and disclosures.\",\n          \"To clarify the accounting for fair market value adjustments, partner equity changes upon exits, and comprehensive disclosure requirements, promoting consistent practices and transparency.\"\n        ],\n        \"scope\": {\n          \"applicable_transactions_entities\": \"This standard applies to Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) utilizing Diminishing Musharaka contracts for real estate investments, specifically within the structure of real estate funds.\",\n          \"exclusions\": \"This standard does not cover other forms of Musharaka, Mudaraba, or other Islamic finance contracts outside the scope of Diminishing Musharaka applied to real estate funds.\"\n        },\n        \"key_shariah_principles\": [\n          \"Adherence to Shari'ah principles of fairness and equity in partner contributions and profit distribution.\",\n          \"Prohibition of Riba (interest) and Gharar (uncertainty) in valuation and partner exit procedures.\",\n          \"Transparency and full disclosure of all contract terms and conditions related to the Diminishing Musharaka.\"\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Definitions\",\n      \"content\": {\n        \"definitions\": [\n          {\n            \"term\": \"Diminishing Musharaka\",\n            \"definition\": \"A form of Shirkah al-\\u02bfAqd (partnership) where one partner gradually reduces their equity share over time as the other partner increases theirs, ultimately leading to the full ownership of the asset by the latter.\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"term\": \"Fair Market Value\",\n            \"definition\": \"The price at which an asset would change hands between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither being under any compulsion to buy or sell and both having reasonable knowledge of relevant facts.\"\n          },\n          {\n            \"term\": \"Shirkah al-\\u02bfAqd\",\n            \"definition\": \"A contractual partnership where two or more parties contribute capital and labor to a business venture, sharing in the profits and losses according to agreed-upon ratios.\"\n          }\n        ]\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"title\": \"Recognition and Initial Measurement\",\n      \"content\": {\n        \"recognition\": {\n          \"general_criteria\": \"A Diminishing Musharaka is recognized when a binding agreement is in place, and the partners have committed to contribute capital and share profits and losses.

The valuation method must align with Shariah principles.\n2.  **Partner Exits:** The changes clarify how to account for gains or losses when a partner exits the Musharaka. Any difference between the exit value and the book value of the partner's share should be recognized immediately as a gain or loss and disclosed in the financial statements.\n3.  **Disclosure Requirements:** We've enhanced the disclosure requirements to ensure greater transparency. Entities using Diminishing Musharaka must now disclose the equity reduction schedule, profit distribution formula, procedures for partner exits (including penalties/restrictions), and the valuation methodology used for the assets.\n\nThese updates aim to address previous gaps in FAS 4, promoting consistent accounting practices and improved transparency in Diminishing Musharaka arrangements.
