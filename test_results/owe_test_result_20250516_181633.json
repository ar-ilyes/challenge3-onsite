  "change_summary": "Here's a summary of the changes to FAS 4, addressing your questions about diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds:\n\nWe've added new guidance to both the Shariah and Accounting sections of FAS 4 to clarify how it applies to Diminishing Musharaka (shirkah al-ʿaqd) in real estate funds. These changes specifically address the valuation of assets, the accounting for partner contributions and equity transfers, and the procedures for partner exits.\n\n**Key Updates:**\n\n*   **Valuation:** New clauses (FAS4.GP1 & FAS4.GP.ACC1) emphasize the need for independent, Shariah-compliant valuations of real estate assets at the start and regularly thereafter, especially when market conditions change. This valuation is crucial for determining the value of partner contributions and equity transfers.\n*   **Partner Contributions:** Clauses FAS4.RMC1 & FAS4.RMC.ACC2 clarify how to recognize and measure partner contributions in a Diminishing Musharaka. As one partner's equity decreases, the accounting treatment should reflect this reduction and the corresponding increase in the other partner's equity. The transfer price should be based on the fair market value at the time of transfer.\n*   **Partner Exits:** Clauses FAS4.PE1 & FAS4.PE.ACC3 provide guidance on how to handle partner exits, ensuring they are Shariah-compliant. This includes performing a fair market valuation of the real estate assets by an independent valuer to determine the exit price. The process adheres to Shariah principles of transparency and fairness, whether through the sale of equity or asset liquidation.\n\n**Why These Changes Were Made:**\n\nThese additions were made to provide clarity and consistency in financial reporting for Diminishing Musharaka structures in real estate funds, as the existing FAS 4 lacked specific guidance in these areas. The updates align FAS 4 with AAOIFI standards (specifically SS 12) and principles of fair valuation, equity transfer, Bai', and liquidation. They ensure that the financial statements accurately reflect the changing equity positions of partners and that all transactions are conducted in a Shariah-compliant manner.",
