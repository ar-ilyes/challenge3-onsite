  "change_summary": "Based on your feedback, FAS 4 has been updated to provide more specific guidance on Diminishing Musharaka structures, particularly within real estate funds, focusing on aspects related to *shirkah al-ʿaqd*, partner contributions, and exits.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key changes:\n\n*   **Initial Recognition and Measurement:** A new section was added to \"FAS 4 - General Principles Relating to Investments - Initial Recognition and Measurement\" to address in-kind contributions (e.g., land or buildings) by partners. It clarifies that these contributions should be recognized at their fair market value at the contribution date, determined by an independent Shariah-compliant valuation and approved by the Shariah Supervisory Board. This value serves as the basis for determining initial ownership percentages.\n\n*   **Subsequent Measurement:** The \"FAS 4 - Subsequent Measurement\" section now includes guidance on how to account for Diminishing Musharaka investments after the initial recognition. This includes dealing with changing ownership percentages as one partner's share increases, revaluations of the underlying real estate assets (at least annually), and the distribution of changes in value among partners according to their ownership percentages and a pre-agreed mechanism. It also clarifies the accounting treatment for partner exits, specifically the valuation of the exiting partner's share at fair market value and the distribution of any profit or loss resulting from the exit.\n\n*   **Disclosures:** \"FAS 4 - Disclosures\" has been expanded to include specific disclosure requirements for Diminishing Musharaka structures in real estate funds. This now requires disclosing:\n    *   A description of the Diminishing Musharaka arrangement and its adherence to *Shirkah al-ʿAqd* principles.\n    *   The mechanism for calculating diminishing ownership percentages.\n    *   The valuation methodologies used for real estate assets, including revaluation frequency.\n    *   The terms governing partner exits (including pre-emption rights and valuation of the departing partner's share).\n    *   Restrictions on transferability of ownership interests.\n    *   The profit and loss sharing ratio.\n    *   The Shariah Supervisory Board’s report on adherence to *Shirkah al-ʿAqd* principles.\n\n*   **Cross-References:** Added cross-references (FAS4.DM.ACC[1-4]) and (FAS4.SH[1-4]) to the new paragraphs in each section to link them to the corresponding Accounting and Shariah rules.\n\nThese changes aim to provide more clarity and ensure compliance with Shariah principles, particularly those related to *shirkah al-ʿaqd*, in Diminishing Musharaka structures within real estate funds, especially regarding partner contributions and exits.",

FAS 4 provides general principles on investment recognition but does not address scenarios where partners contribute assets (e.g., land, existing buildings) instead of cash to the Musharaka.

FAS 4 doesn't explicitly address the impact of these changing ownership percentages on the accounting treatment of the investment, especially the valuation of the underlying real estate. Furthermore, the standard lacks specific guidance on accounting for partner exits, including the determination of the fair value of the exiting partner's share and its impact on the remaining partners' investment balance, which is vital given Shirkah al-ʿAqd emphasizes fairness and transparency during partnership dissolution or partial exits."

      "shariah_solution": "To address the identified gaps in FAS 4 regarding diminishing Musharaka structures within real estate funds, particularly concerning Shirkah al-ʿAqd principles, the following Shariah solution is proposed:\n\n1.  **Initial Recognition and Measurement of In-Kind Contributions:** Establish a mechanism for fair valuation of assets contributed in-kind (e.g., land, buildings) by partners, involving independent Shariah-compliant valuation. The valuation should be approved by the Shariah Supervisory Board and reflect the fair market value at the time of contribution. The value assigned should be used for determining the initial ownership percentages in the Musharaka.\n2.  **Subsequent Measurement and Changing Ownership Percentages:** Define a clear methodology for accounting for the changing ownership percentages in a diminishing Musharaka. Revaluations of the underlying real estate assets should be conducted periodically (e.g., annually or upon significant market changes) by an independent Shariah-compliant valuer, with any changes in value being distributed amongst the partners according to their ownership percentages at the time of the revaluation. The distribution mechanism should be pre-agreed upon by all partners.\n3.  **Partner Exits:** Provide explicit guidance on the accounting treatment of partner exits. This includes specifying the valuation methodology for the exiting partner's share (which should be based on fair market value at the time of exit), the pre-emption rights of remaining partners (if any), and the impact of the exit on the remaining partners' investment balance. Any profit or loss resulting from the exit should be distributed according to the pre-agreed profit/loss sharing ratio at the time of exit, and should take into account the change in ownership percentage that is occurring.\n4.  **Enhanced Disclosure Requirements:** Mandate specific disclosures related to the key terms and conditions of the diminishing Musharaka, including the mechanism for calculating diminishing ownership percentages, the valuation methodologies used for real estate assets, the terms governing partner exits (including pre-emption rights and valuation of departing partner’s share), and the frequency and methodology for revaluations.

It uses fair market value determined by an independent Shariah-compliant valuer and approved by the Shariah Supervisory Board, consistent with Shariah requirements and standard valuation practices (IFRS 13). This addresses the gap identified by FCIA related to the lack of guidance on valuing in-kind contributions, ensuring equitable contribution and profit/loss sharing.\n\nFAS4.DM.ACC2 addresses the subsequent measurement of the diminishing Musharaka investment, particularly concerning the changing ownership percentages, adhering to AAOIFI AS 12 (4/2). Periodic revaluations by an independent Shariah-compliant valuer are mandated, with changes in value distributed according to ownership percentages, as agreed upon in the Musharaka agreement. The gains and losses are recognised according to the accounting policy for similar real estate investments. This clause fills the gap related to unclear subsequent measurement due to changing ownership, ensuring fairness and reflecting economic reality.\n\nFAS4.DM.ACC3 provides guidance on partner exits, consistent with AAOIFI AS 12 (5/3) and principles of Khiyar al-Shart (option to stipulate conditions) within Shirkah. The exiting partner's share is valued at fair market value at the time of exit. The profit or loss resulting from the exit is distributed according to the pre-agreed profit/loss sharing ratio at the time of exit, considering the change in ownership percentage. This ensures transparency and fairness during dissolution or partial exits, addressing the identified gap.\n\nFAS4.DM.ACC4 addresses the inadequate disclosure requirements, aligning with AAOIFI Governance Standard 2 (6/1) and the general principle of transparency (wضوح). It mandates specific disclosures related to the diminishing Musharaka structure, including the mechanism for calculating diminishing ownership percentages, the valuation methodologies used, the terms governing partner exits, any transfer restrictions, profit/loss sharing ratio and the Shariah Supervisory Board's report. This aims to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of the risks and rewards associated with the structure and ensure Shariah compliance.\n\nThese clauses are designed to be practical for IFIs and consistent with existing accounting frameworks (FAS, AAOIFI AS, and relevant IFRS principles) while ensuring adherence to Shariah principles.",

    "change_summary": "Based on your feedback, FAS 4 has been updated to provide more specific guidance on Diminishing Musharaka structures, particularly within real estate funds, focusing on aspects related to *shirkah al-ʿaqd*, partner contributions, and exits.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the key changes:\n\n*   **Initial Recognition and Measurement:** A new section was added to \"FAS 4 - General Principles Relating to Investments - Initial Recognition and Measurement\" to address in-kind contributions (e.g., land or buildings) by partners. It clarifies that these contributions should be recognized at their fair market value at the contribution date, determined by an independent Shariah-compliant valuation and approved by the Shariah Supervisory Board. This value serves as the basis for determining initial ownership percentages.\n\n*   **Subsequent Measurement:** The \"FAS 4 - Subsequent Measurement\" section now includes guidance on how to account for Diminishing Musharaka investments after the initial recognition. This includes dealing with changing ownership percentages as one partner's share increases, revaluations of the underlying real estate assets (at least annually), and the distribution of changes in value among partners according to their ownership percentages and a pre-agreed mechanism. It also clarifies the accounting treatment for partner exits, specifically the valuation of the exiting partner's share at fair market value and the distribution of any profit or loss resulting from the exit.\n\n*   **Disclosures:** \"FAS 4 - Disclosures\" has been expanded to include specific disclosure requirements for Diminishing Musharaka structures in real estate funds. This now requires disclosing:\n    *   A description of the Diminishing Musharaka arrangement and its adherence to *Shirkah al-ʿAqd* principles.\n    *   The mechanism for calculating diminishing ownership percentages.\n    *   The valuation methodologies used for real estate assets, including revaluation frequency.\n    *   The terms governing partner exits (including pre-emption rights and valuation of the departing partner's share).\n    *   Restrictions on transferability of ownership interests.\n    *   The profit and loss sharing ratio.\n    *   The Shariah Supervisory Board’s report on adherence to *Shirkah al-ʿAqd* principles.\n\n*   **Cross-References:** Added cross-references (FAS4.DM.ACC[1-4]) and (FAS4.SH[1-4]) to the new paragraphs in each section to link them to the corresponding Accounting and Shariah rules.\n\nThese changes aim to provide more clarity and ensure compliance with Shariah principles, particularly those related to *shirkah al-ʿaqd*, in Diminishing Musharaka structures within real estate funds, especially regarding partner contributions and exits.",

This valuation shall serve as the basis for determining the initial ownership percentages of the partners. Any costs directly attributable to preparing the asset for its intended use shall be capitalized. (FAS4.DM.ACC1) (FAS4.SH1)",
      "FAS 4 - Subsequent Measurement": "FAS 4 - Subsequent Measurement\n\nInvestments are subsequently measured in accordance with applicable accounting standards. The method of subsequent measurement depends on the nature of the investment and the accounting policies of the reporting entity.\n\nThe investment in a diminishing Musharaka shall be subsequently measured to reflect the changing ownership percentages. Revaluations of the underlying real estate assets shall be performed periodically, at least annually, by an independent Shariah-compliant valuer. Changes in value shall be distributed among the partners according to their ownership percentages at the time of revaluation, as per a pre-agreed distribution mechanism documented within the Musharaka agreement. The accounting treatment for changes in value should be consistent with the accounting policy for similar real estate investments, recognizing gains and losses in profit or loss or other comprehensive income, as appropriate. (FAS4.DM.ACC2) (FAS4.SH2)\n\nUpon a partner's exit from the diminishing Musharaka, the exiting partner's share shall be valued at its fair market value at the time of exit, as determined by an independent Shariah-compliant valuation. Any pre-emption rights of the remaining partners shall be exercised in accordance with Shariah principles and disclosed. The impact of the exit on the remaining partners' investment balance shall be accounted for, and any profit or loss resulting from the exit shall be distributed according to the pre-agreed profit/loss sharing ratio at the time of exit. This distribution shall take into account the change in ownership percentage occurring as a result of the exit. Transaction costs directly attributable to the exit shall be expensed. (FAS4.DM.ACC3) (FAS4.SH3)",
      "FAS 4 - Disclosures": "FAS 4 - Disclosures\n\nThe financial statements shall disclose the following information about investments:\n\n*   The nature of the investments\n*   The carrying amount of the investments\n*   The method of subsequent measurement\n*   Any significant restrictions on the investments\n\nThe following information relating to diminishing Musharaka structures within real estate funds shall be disclosed: (a) a description of the diminishing Musharaka arrangement, including the Shirkah al-ʿAqd principles it adheres to; (b) the mechanism for calculating diminishing ownership percentages; (c) the valuation methodologies used for real estate assets, including the frequency of revaluations and the rationale for selecting the valuation method; (d) the terms governing partner exits, including pre-emption rights and the valuation of the departing partner’s share; (e) any restrictions on the transferability of ownership interests; (f) the profit and loss sharing ratio; and (g) the Shariah Supervisory Board’s report on the adherence to Shirkah al-ʿAqd principles. Additionally, disclose the carrying amount of the diminishing Musharaka investment separately from other investments. (FAS4.DM.ACC4) (FAS4.SH4)"
