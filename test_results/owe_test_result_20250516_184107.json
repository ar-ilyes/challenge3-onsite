  "change_summary": "Based on your concerns about Diminishing Musharaka in real estate funds and FAS 4's coverage of *shirkah al-ʿaqd* structures, we've updated FAS 4 to provide more specific guidance.\n\nHere's what's new:\n\n*   **Diminishing Musharaka in Real Estate Funds:** We've added specific Shariah and accounting clauses (FAS4.DM1-6, FAS4.DM.ACC1-6) focused on these funds.\n*   ***Shirkah al-ʿAqd* Clarification:** The updates clarify how *shirkah al-ʿaqd* principles apply to real estate funds, ensuring compliance with Shariah.\n*   **Profit and Loss Distribution:** There's now detailed guidance on how to distribute profits and losses based on partners' capital contributions and how these change over time (especially in diminishing Musharaka).\n*   **Real Estate Valuation:** We've established clear rules for valuing real estate assets, emphasizing fair market value and using independent appraisers.\n*   **Partner Exits:** The updated standard defines procedures for partner exits and unit redemptions, again based on fair market value and pre-defined mechanisms.\n*   **Enhanced Disclosures:** Diminishing Musharaka real estate funds now have more extensive disclosure requirements. This includes details about the assets, profit-sharing arrangements, valuation methods, and risk management practices.\n\nThese changes aim to address the gaps in FAS 4 regarding real estate funds, particularly concerning asset valuation, profit/loss distribution, partner exits, and transparency. The updates are aligned with AAOIFI standards and relevant accounting guidance to ensure consistent and Shariah-compliant practices.",

The current standard may not fully capture the nuances of these situations, potentially leading to disputes or unfair distribution of profits and losses. The dynamics of diminishing Musharaka, where the equity stake changes over time, need specific considerations for profit distribution.",

The standard needs to provide more specific guidance on how to value real estate assets within a Musharaka context, considering factors like market conditions, property appraisals, and potential impairments.
